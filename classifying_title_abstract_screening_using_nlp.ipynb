Five major cultivars were cultivated to consider the cultivar characteristics and environmental factors for two years were collected to consider the climate difference. Faster R–CNN based object detector was used to estimate the number of receptacles per strawberry plant in given two-dimensional images, which achieved a mAP of 0.6587 for our dataset. However, not all receptacles appear on the two-dimensional images, and Bayesian analysis was used to model the uncertainty associated with the number of receptacles missed by the AI. After estimating the probability of fruiting per receptacle, prediction models for the total strawberry yield at the end of harvest season were evaluated. Even though the detection accuracy was not perfect, the results indicated that counting the receptacles by object detection and estimating the probability of fruiting per receptacle by Bayesian modeling are more useful for predicting the total yield per plant than knowing its cumulative yield during the first month.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Intelligent harvesting can greatly reduce the manual labor for fruit harvesting and is one of the main application areas of intelligent agricultural machinery. Smart edge sensors must detect the growth status of tomatoes and strawberries in real-time for intelligent harvesting to be possible. Due to edge devices' relatively low image processing power, it remains challenging to implement deep learning algorithms for real-time detection in field applications. Therefore, scholars are strongly interested in utilizing computationally small, accurate, and quick models for edge harvesting machinery. In this research, we propose RTFD, a lightweight algorithm for edge CPU devices that detects fruit. Based on the PicoDet-S model, RTFD optimizes the efficiency of real-time detection for edge CPU computing devices by enhancing the model's structure, loss function and activation function. The experimental results demonstrate that the mAP of RTFD for tomato and strawberry datasets at various growth phases is 0.78 and 0.96, respectively, with a computational effort of 1.44 GFLOPs. RTFD improves mAP by 1.9\\\\% and 2.3\\\\% on the tomato and strawberry datasets, respectively, with minimal loss in computation and model parameters, making it more suitable for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, we proposed an approach for 8-bit quantization-aware training of the Conv2D and Linear layers of the model for improved edge deployment. This approach quantizes 32-bit floating-point values in the Conv2D and Linear layers into 8-bit integers, thereby reducing the model's size and accelerating detection speed. The testing findings indicate that the quantized RTFD model has a size of 1.33 MB and a CPU detection speed of around 11 FPS. Using the quantified trained model, we developed the Android application RTFD-CPU to evaluate the model's performance in test scenarios. RTFD-CPU was assessed on the smartphone Redmi K30pro (Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 CPU and 8 GB of RAM) with a detection speed of 19 FPS utilizing only the CPU. In summary, the proposed RTFD has great potential for intelligent picking machines, and the concept of redesigning the model structure, loss function, and activation function, as well as training by quantization to speed up the detection of deep neural networks, is anticipated to be successfully implemented in edge computing.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The precision spraying robot dispensing herbicides only on unwanted plants based on machine vision detection is the most appropriate approach to ensure the sustainable agro-ecosystem and the minimum impact of nuisance weeds. However, the coexistence of crops and weeds, the similarities of plants and the multi-scale attribute of weeds make reliable detection difficult, leading to serious limitations in the application of deep learning method to target spraying in the field environment. In this paper, 4694 representative images are acquired from cotton field scenario as the data basis for deep learning model. A novel weed detection model is constructed by employing CBAM module, BiFPN structure and Bilinear interpolation algorithm. The proposed network can effectively learn the deep information and distinguish weeds from cotton seedlings in various complicated growth states. Evaluation experiments on our constructed dataset indicate that the proposed method reaches an mAP of 98.43\\\\% with faster inference speed than Faster R-CNN. Our proposed weed detection model is also deployed in spraying robot that we developed ourselves, and field trials are conducted for detection and spraying, which could maintain the excellent performance with mAP of 97.42\\\\% and effective spraying rate of 98.93\\\\%. The ability to successfully execute the weed detection and herbicide spraying management in the field lays foundation for targeted spraying in precision weed control, which has an excellent impact on cotton cultivation and growth.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The growing population and effect of climate change have put a huge responsibility on the agriculture sector to increase food-grain production and productivity. In most of the countries where the expansion of cropland is merely impossible, agriculture automation has become the only option and is the need of the hour. Internet of things and Artificial intelligence have already started capitalizing across all the industries including agriculture. Advancement in these digital technologies has made revolutionary changes in agriculture by providing smart systems that can monitor, control, and visualize various farm operations in real-time and with comparable intelligence of human experts. The potential applications of IoT and AI in the development of smart farm machinery, irrigation systems, weed and pest control, fertilizer application, greenhouse cultivation, storage structures, drones for plant protection, crop health monitoring, etc. are discussed in the paper. The main objective of the paper is to provide an overview of recent research in the area of digital technology-driven agriculture and identification of the most prominent applications in the field of agriculture engineering using artificial intelligence and internet of things. The research work done in the areas during the last 10 years has been reviewed from the scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. It has been observed that the digitization of agriculture using AI and IoT has matured from their nascent conceptual stage and reached the execution phase. The technical details of artificial intelligence, IoT, and challenges related to the adoption of these digital technologies are also discussed. This will help in understanding how digital technologies can be integrated into agriculture practices and pave the way for the implementation of AI and IoT-based solutions in the farms.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Smart farming is a well-known and superior method of managing a farm, becoming more prevalent in today's contemporary agricultural practices. Crops are monitored for their overall health and productivity using various information and agricultural technology. This involves monitoring the state of the field crops and looking at various other indicators. The ultimate objective of smart farming is to decrease the amount of money spent on agricultural inputs while maintaining the same level of quality in the final result. The Internet of Things has enabled smart farming via different data collecting and storage methods. For example, intelligent sensor networks gather field data for optimum plant irrigation in contemporary irrigation systems. As the dependency of smart farming on the IoT environment increases, they become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The reason is that IoT networks include so many nodes with few resources available, making securing them a challenging problem. Therefore, the need for an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can adapt to such difficulties is of the utmost importance. This paper proposes a new system that detects intrusions in IoT networks used in agriculture. The NSL KDD data set is used to evaluate the proposed method, which starts by performing several pre-processing steps on the original feature set. Important features are selected using recursive feature elimination, then converted into square color images. Now input images are suitable to be learned by different CNN architectures such as VGG16, Inception, and Xception models. Performance comparisons of CNN models with classical machine learning algorithms are evaluated using accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, and precision metrics.\",\n",

In this background, the current article introduces a novel Hybrid Leader-based Optimization with DL-driven Weed Detection in IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture (HLBODL-WDSA) model. The prime aim of the proposed HLBODL-WDSA model is to collect the images using IoT devices and recognize the weeds automatically. Initially, the HLBODL-WDSA model enables the IoT devices to capture the farm images and transmits the images to the cloud server for examination. Next, the HLBODL-WDSA model applies YOLO-v5-based weed detection process in which HLBO algorithm is exploited as a hyperparameter optimizer. Finally, the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) model is applied for effective classification of the weeds. The proposed HLBODL-WDSA model was experimentally validated and the outcomes established the better performance of the proposed HLBODL-WDSA model over recent approaches.',\n",

To monitor and operate activities from remote locations, UAVs extended their freedom of operation. For smart farming, it's significant to use UAV prospects. On the other hand, the cost and convenience of using UAVs for smart-farming may be a major factor in farmers’ decisions to use UAVs in farming. The IoT-based module is used to update the database with monitored data. Using this method, live data should be updated soon, and it can help in crop cultivation identification. Research also monitor climatic conditions using live satellite data.

Old-fashioned pest detection is unstable and gives inaccurate forecasts. These surveillance tactics are intrusive, expensive, and vulnerable to assumptions. Pest sounds can be caught with minimum effort by utilizing IoT networks. Deep learning algorithms, species distribution range assessments, and nature monitoring can automatically identify and categorize pest sounds.

       "  'abstract': \"Smart livestock farming strives to make farming more lucrative, efficient, and ecologically beneficial by using digital technologies. Precision livestock fencing, in which each animal is followed and studied independently, is the most promising kind of smart livestock farming. The Internet of Things (IoT) allows farmers to save money and effort by keeping tabs on crops, mapping out their land, and giving them data to develop sensible management strategies for their farms. Surveillance, disaster management, firefighting, border patrol, and courier services employ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that are originally created for the military. The segment focuses on UAVs in livestock and agricultural production. This is achieved via employing robots, drones, remote sensors, and computer imagery in unison with ever-improving in-Depth Learning for farming. Deep learning (DL) algorithms find many uses in the agricultural sector, from identifying plant diseases to estimating yields to detecting weeds to forecasting the weather and determining how much water is in the soil. The challenging characteristics of smart livestock farming are climate change, biodiversity loss, and continuous monitoring. Hence, in this research, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles enabled Integrated Farm Management (UAV-IFM) has been designed to improve smart livestock farming. Safe and reliable tracking of livestock from farm to fork is made possible by this sensor, which has far-reaching implications for detecting and containing disease outbreaks and preventing the resulting financial losses and food-related health pandemics. UAV-IFM aims to improve the assessment process so that smart livestock farming may be more widely adopted and offers growth-supportive help to farmers. Conclusions gathered from this study's examination of the UAV-IFM reveal that these instruments correctly forecast and verify smart livestock farming management within the framework of the assessment procedure. The experimental analysis of UAV-IFM outperforms smart livestock farming in terms of efficiency ratio, performance, accuracy, and prediction.\",\n",

In this study, 129 papers that are based on DL applications used in agriculture are discussed, categorizing them into five areas: crop yield prediction, plant stress detection, weed and pest detection, disease detection, and smart farming. Smart farming is sub-categorized as water management, seed analysis, and soil analysis. This study highlights the potential of deep learning in enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting economic growth. The study found that supervised learning networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), AlexNet, and ResNet, are primarily used in agriculture to enhance economic growth. However, there is a need to develop new DL techniques that can improve model performance and reduce inference time for practical applications. In this review, critical research gaps, particularly in the development of new techniques, are analyzed.

Internet of Things is the one among them and used for automatic smart farming applications. Hence to overcome the issues faced in the wide agriculture sector most of the farmers are now changed to IoT based applications and in the meantime many scientists also used artificial intelligence techniques to predict the diseases of the crops from the data collected using the IoT sensors in the agriculture farming. The sensors gather data from crops and fused with the local unit and forwarded to the cluster heads of network. To achieve the disease free crops and therein improve the productivity we have proposed a novel energy efficient IoT based smart farming approach, in which we have utilized K-means algorithm for the cluster formation and Adaptive Mud Ring optimization algorithm (AMR) for CH and energy efficient optimal path. The collected data via the CH are then stored in the cloud storage. Subsequently, the data are accessed via the proposed Hybrid Artificial Neural Network (HANN) to predict the diseases. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is hybridized using the Google Net in order to extract the exact features to predict the diseases. Performance validation is effectuated with Network Simulator-2 (NS-2) software and the results are compared with the state-of-art works. Several parameters such as energy efficiency, delay, network lifetime, accuracy and etc, are used for analyzing and our approach surpasses all the other approaches.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture farms such as crop, aquaculture and livestock have begun the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in improving their productivity and product quality. However, microalgae farming which requires precise monitoring, controlling and predicting the growth of microalgae biomass has yet to incorporate with IoT and AI technology, as it is still in its infancy phase. Particularly, the cultivation stage of microalgae involves many essential parameters (i.e. biomass concentration, pH, light intensity, temperature and tank level) which require precise monitoring as these parameters are important to ensure an effective biomass productivity in the microalgae farming. Besides, the conventional practices in the current process equipment are still powered by electricity, thus further development by integrating IoT into these processes can ease the production process. Further to that, many researchers has studied the machine learning approach for the identification and classification of microalgae. However, there are still limited studies reported on applying machine learning for the application of microalgae industry such as optimising microalgae cultivation for higher biomass productivity. Therefore, the implementation of IoT and AI in microalgae farming can contribute to the development of the global microalgae industry. The purpose of this current review paper focuses on the overview microalgae biomass production process along with the implementation of IoT toward the future of smart farming. To bridge the gap between the conventional and microalgae smart farming, this paper also highlights the insights on the implementation phases of microalgae smart farming starting from the infant stage that involves the installation and programming of IoT hardware. Then, it is followed by the application of machine learning to predict and auto-optimise the microalgae smart farming process. Furthermore, the process setup and detailed overview of microalgae farming with the integration of IoT have been discussed critically. This review paper would provide a new vision of microalgae farming for microalgae researchers and bio-processing industries into the digitalisation industrial era.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Crop health monitoring and weed removal are two crucial elements dictating efficient, productive and resilient cultivation. Due to frequent attacks by pest and pathogens, the crops become diseased resulting in degradation of the quality and quantity of the production. The process of continuous monitoring of crop health is challenging and requires the involvement of information and communication technologies (ICT). The outcome is precision agriculture where the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are vital ingredients. The design of an integrated approach of precision agriculture based on IoT and AI is discussed here which is tailored for real time crop health monitoring and performs various other operations like weed detection, ambient air sensing, watering the vegetation automatically at regular intervals of time, spraying of pesticides etc. The proposed system is a combination of an IoT formed using sensors and devices, image processing and machine learning (ML)/ deep learning (DL) techniques confined to the cultivation of fifteen varieties of beans found in India. The work involves two intelligent learning models configured to capture spatio-temporal attributes of image samples and sensor inputs and for real time discrimination between healthy and diseased bean leaves, detection of weeds growing around the cultivation land and also for process control. The first approach employs a DL structure named EfficientNetB7 along with a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) while the second method adopts a VGG16 with an integrated attention mechanism. Also experiments have been carried out using benchmark ML classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) combined with feature extraction techniques. Segmentation methods have been used to separate out the diseased sections of the leaves which are then used as apriori labels for the classifiers to reinforce the previously known details of the bean varieties. Subsequently, the trained networks are tested with bean leaf samples collected from cultivation farms. Results show that our proposed DL models could accurately predict the health state of the bean leaves with less computation time. With an automated approach of bean leaf health discrimination, weed detection and process control, the cost effectiveness of the overall effort is enhanced. Further, the sensor pack also provides precise thresholds at which water sprinkling could be initiated resulting in water conservation.',\n",

Nearly 58 percent of a country’s primary source of livelihood is farming. Farmers till date had adopted conventional farming techniques. These techniques were not precise thus reduced the productivity and consumed a lot of time. Precise farming helps to increase the productivity by precisely determining the steps that needs to be practiced at its due season. Predicting the weather conditions, analyzing the soil, recommending the crops for cultivation, determine the amount of fertilizers, pesticides that need to be used are some elements of precision farming. Precise Farming uses advanced technologies such as IOT, Data Mining, Data Analytics, Machine Learning to collect the data, train the systems and predict the results. With the help of technologies Precise farming helps to reduce manual labor and increase productivity. Farmers have been facing various challenges in these recent times, this includes crop failure due to less rainfall, infertility of soil and so on. Due to the changes taking place in the environment the proposed work helps to identify how to manage crops and harvest in a smart way. It guides an individual for smart farming. The aim of this work is to help an individual cultivate crops efficiently and hence achieve high productivity at low cost. It also helps to predict the total cost needed for cultivation. This would help an individual to pre-plan the activities before cultivation resulting in an integrated solution in farming.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In the face of increasing agricultural demands and environmental concerns, the effective management of weeds presents a pressing challenge in modern agriculture. Weeds not only compete with crops for resources but also pose threats to food safety and agricultural sustainability through the indiscriminate use of herbicides, which can lead to environmental contamination and herbicide-resistant weed populations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a paradigm shift in agriculture, particularly in the domain of weed management. AI's utilization in this domain extends beyond mere innovation, offering precise and eco-friendly solutions for the identification and control of weeds, thereby addressing critical agricultural challenges. This article aims to examine the application of AI in weed management in the context of weed detection and the increasing impact of deep learning techniques in the agricultural sector. Through an assessment of research articles, this study identifies critical factors influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in weed management. These criteria encompass factors of AI adoption (food safety, increased effectiveness, and eco-friendliness through herbicides reduction), AI implementation factors (capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and outcomes and accuracy), ancillary technologies (IoT, UAV, field robots, and herbicides), and the related impact of AI methods adoption (economic, social, technological, and environmental). Of the 5821 documents found, 99 full-text articles were assessed, and 68 were included in this study. The review highlights AI's role in enhancing food safety by reducing herbicide residues, increasing effectiveness in weed control strategies, and promoting eco-friendliness through judicious herbicide use. It underscores the importance of capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and accuracy metrics in AI implementation, emphasizing their synergy in revolutionizing weed management practices. Ancillary technologies, such as IoT, UAVs, field robots, and AI-enhanced herbicides, complement AI's capabilities, offering holistic and data-driven approaches to weed control. Additionally, the adoption of AI methods influences economic, social, technological, and environmental dimensions of agriculture. Last but not least, digital literacy emerges as a crucial enabler, empowering stakeholders to navigate AI technologies effectively and contribute to the sustainable transformation of weed management practices in agriculture.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"India's agricultural sector is dwindling, which has an impact on ecosystem output. Smart farming increases crop productivity by reducing waste and making effective use of fertiliser. Various Machine Learning techniques together with IoT enabled are developed for precision agriculture. However, the existing techniques face difficulties in forecasting weather and predicting disease accurately. In this work, a system is developed to automate weather forecasting and field monitoring using sensors. Wireless transmission is used to transfer sensor data to a web server database. In the first step, the collected data is pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data is then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. In the second step, crop images acquired from sensors for disease prediction are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization for contrast enhancement of image. Pre-processed images are then fed into ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by the systems. On the other hand, regarding the information about horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers. The proposed method is tested with several metrics which attain better performance like 94\\\\% accuracy for weather forecasting and 98\\\\% accuracy for field monitoring. Thus the proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support farmers to achieve a high quantity of crop production in lesser time.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent advances in communication technologies with the emergence of connected objects have changed the agricultural area. In this new digital age, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has allowed for acceleration and improvement in the processing of collected data. To highlight the evolution and advances observed in deep learning in agriculture, we conducted a bibliometric study on more than 400 recent research studies. The analyses carried out on recent research works suggest that deep learning is widely involved in the digitization of agriculture areas with high accuracy exceeding the standard image processing techniques. Most of the works focus on crop classification problems, weed, and pest identification. Their methods are mainly based on convolutional neural network architecture. From the cases study, we have identified three key challenges that are essential in the deep learning methods applied in agriculture: (i) the need to consider the perception of the domain actors, their appropriation or interaction with the existing tools; (ii) the requirement to perform statistical tests to analyze the performance of the classifiers resulting from the learning process; and (iii) the need to perform statistical cross-validations with the training data. In the end, we summarized the agricultural data processing process consisting of several parts, for a better consideration of the expectations resulting from the challenges addressed. We consider that this study can serve as a guideline of research for the scientist and practician in the application of deep learning methodology in agriculture.',\n",

Machine learning, Deep learning, and time series analysis are essential in smart farming. Crop selection, crop yield prediction, soil compatibility classification, water management, and many other processes are involved in agriculture. Machine learning algorithms are used for crop selection and management, Deep learning techniques are used for crop selection and forecasting crop production, and time series analysis is used for demand forecasting of crops, commodity price prediction, and crop yield production forecasting. Crops are chosen using machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms based on soil, soil compatibility classification, and other factors. In the agriculture industry, this article offers a thorough review of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Crop data sets can be used to classify soil fertility, crop selection, and many other aspects using machine learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithms can be applied to farming data to do time series analysis and crop selection. Because there is more need for food due to the growing population, crop production forecasting is one of the crucial tasks. Therefore, future crop production must be predicted in order to overcome food insufficiency. In this article, several time series algorithms were reviewed. Suggesting appropriate crop recommendations using machine and deep learning by estimating crop yield by using time series analysis will reduce food insufficiency in the future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture is one of the oldest occupations in the world and continues to exist today. In some form or another, the world’s population depends on agriculture for its needs. The major loss in sugarcane production in India is due to pests, plant disease, malnutrition, and nutrient deficiency in plants. To identify these diseases, farmers go to local farmers, experts, agricultural people, and fellow neighbors to identify the problem caused. In some cases, their information may be adequate, but in others it is not. These people cannot solve all the problems caused by their crops can be solved by these people; there is a need to accurately predict the correct disease and provide the proper treatment at the right time. This can only be done by applying machine learning-based Internet of Things solutions in real time. This article proposes a method for a smart farming system to address the needs of farmers producing sugarcane in India by applying intelligent solutions that use image processing and soft computing. Four sugarcane diseases are investigated, such as Eyespot, Leaf Scald, Yellow Leaf, and Pokkah Boeng, and three characteristics such as color, shape, and texture. Images were used for training data in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Neuro-Fuzzy, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) algorithms, and the performance of the feature extraction technique was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Huge economic losses occur in the agricultural industry due to bacterial, viral or fungal infections in crops due to which farmers incur 15–20\\\\% losses on their profits annually. India is the second largest producer of rice and a leading exporter of the same in the global market. Thus, early disease detection in crops is essential. Implementing Smart Farming is a burning area of research in order to prevent further damage to crops. The widespread development of Deep Learning makes it possible to achieve the goal of disease detection in crops. In this paper we have proposed an intelligent model based on Smart farming integrating Machine Learning with the IoT network. The novelty of this project is early detection of Brown spot disease in rice paddy for the very first time using Convolutional Neural Networks. Deep Learning uses Neural Networks to implement Artificial Intelligence. This project makes use of Image recognition and pre-processing based on real time data. Data pre-processing and feature extraction has been done using a self-designed image-processing tool.

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been extensively applied in farming recently. To cultivate healthier crops, manage pests, monitor soil and growing conditions, analyse data for farmers, and enhance other management activities of the food supply chain, the agriculture sector is turning to AI technology. It makes it challenging for farmers to choose the ideal time to plant seeds. AI helps farmers choose the optimum seed for a particular weather scenario. It also offers data on weather forecasts. AI-powered solutions will help farmers produce more with fewer resources, increase crop quality, and hasten product time to reach the market. AI aids in understanding soil qualities. AI helps farmers by suggesting the nutrients they should apply to increase the quality of the soil. AI can help farmers choose the optimal time to plant their seeds. Intelligent equipment can calculate the spacing between seeds and the maximum planting depth. An AI-powered system known as a health monitoring system provides farmers with information on the health of their crops and the nutrients that need to be given to enhance yield quality and quantity. This study identifies and analyses relevant articles on AI for Agriculture. Using AI, farmers can now access advanced data and analytics tools that will foster better farming, improve efficiencies, and reduce waste in biofuel and food production while minimising the negative environmental impacts. AI and Machine Learning (ML) have transformed various industries, and the AI wave has now reached the agriculture sector. Companies are developing several technologies to make monitoring farmers' crop and soil health easier. Hyperspectral imaging and 3D laser scanning are the leading AI-based technologies that can help ensure crop health. These AI-powered technologies collect precise data on the health of the crops in greater volume for analysis. This paper studied AI and its need in Agriculture. The process of AI in Agriculture and some Agriculture parameters monitored by AI are briefed. Finally, we identified and discussed the significant applications of AI in agriculture.\",\n",

Various researches and analysis have been conducted and numerous methods have been incorporated to apply IoT technology on agronomical fields. IoT can play a vital role in timely detection of declining plant health so that appropriate measures can be taken. It is a huge step towards smart agriculture. In this paper we propose a model to build up an automated framework which will recognize the crop decay in the initial phase which is imperceptible to naked human eyes. This model helps in prevention of huge losses and also save a lot of time and labor. The proposed model builds a recognition framework using sensors like humidity, moisture, temperature and color of the plant leaf. The data from the sensors is sent to Arduino to Cloud which then analyzes the data and helps in identifying the plant decay.

One of these important effects on low crop yields is diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and viruses. This can be prevented and handled by means of applying plant disease detection approaches. Machine learning techniques will be employed in the process of disease identification on plants as it mostly applies information themselves and offers fabulous techniques for detection of plant diseases. Methods based on Machine learning can be employed for the identification of diseases because it mainly applies on data superiority outcomes for specified task. In this approach, a comprehensive review has been made on the various techniques employed in plant disease detection using artificial intelligence (AI) based machine learning and deep learning techniques. Likewise, deep learning has also gained a great deal of significance in offering better performance outcome for detecting plant disease in the computer vision field. The deep learning advancements were employed to a range of domains that leads to great attainment in the machine learning and computer vision areas. The comparative study is made in terms of machine and deep learning techniques and their performance and usage in various research papers is related to show the effectiveness of deep learning model over machine learning model.

       "  'abstract': \"Agriculture plays a vital role in feeding the growing global population. But optimizing crop production and resource management remains a significant challenge for farmers. This research paper proposes an innovative ML-enabled IoT device to monitor soil nutrients and provide accurate crop recommendations. The device utilizes the FC-28 sensor, DHT11 sensor, and JXBS-3001 sensor to collect real-time data on soil composition, moisture, humidity, temperature, and for nutrient levels. The collected data is transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze the collected data and generate customized recommendations, including a possible high-yielding crop list, fertilizer names, and its amount based on crop requirements and soil nutrients. Furthermore, the applied fertilizers and treatments to the field during production are stored in the database. As a result, it has become possible to determine the quality of the produce at the consumer level through the mobile app. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through field experiments, comparing its performance with traditional methods. The results demonstrate the device's ability to enhance crop productivity and optimize resource utilization, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and food security. The research contributes to IoT-enabled agriculture, demonstrating the potential of ML techniques in improving soil nutrient management, facilitating informed decision-making about crop fertilizers, and assessing the quality of produced crops at the consumer level.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The most amount of withdrawn freshwater in the world is used for agriculture activities to extract essential products for human survival. Smart Farming can manage and optimize the water amount given to crop fields in various crop development stages, weather, and soil condition. Sensors installed in several monitoring spots can gather soil moisture of the crop field to indicate the level of water retained in it. However, due to connectivity or sensor failure problems, the smart farming system can not receive the soil moisture data given by the irrigation management. Deep learning techniques can predict soil moisture data using other irrigation management types as data from weather, crop, and irrigation systems. The Fog Computing paradigm also tackles the connectivity problem in the farms since it extends the traditional cloud computing architecture to the edge of the network, providing edge nodes with computational resources to process and analyze sensor requests. In this context, we propose different deep neural network architectures to build prediction models of soil moisture. We also handle the problem of missing data for the dataset features. For this purpose, we use KNN data imputation, which requires filling the values of unknown (or missing) features with values that ensure a desired degree of reliability. Finally, we also embedded the prediction models on a small single-board computer, often used as a fog node, to evaluate the performance of the prediction models according to CPU and RAM usage. This evaluation showed a maximum consumption increase of 10\\\\% CPU and 1\\\\% RAM. Therefore, the models are viable to fog architectures in the Internet of Things context. Our results indicate that the predictive models achieve a satisfactory efficiency to improve irrigation water saving.',\n",

Weather monitoring and management is a significant feature for mushroom growth, especially the impact of temperature and humidity. Most of the farmers in remote areas worldwide use traditional ways to cultivate the mushrooms. The traditional way is very complicated, and often poisonous mushrooms appear due to the lack of sufficient weather and cultivation process monitoring. This paper reflects an architectural design of IoT \\\\& Machine Learning (ML)-based Smart Mushroom Farming. The proposed system introduces Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM), Farm Automation, and Mushroom classification. The Internet of Things (IoT), the microcontroller ESP32, and some agriculture-related sensors enable smart monitoring and farm automation. Machine Learning (ML) technology has been adopted to classify edible mushrooms to avoid poisonous mushrooms. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed system, several experiments have been enumerated and interpreted. The study is further furnished with the System Usability Scale (SUS) to track the regular user's satisfaction and gained the SUS score of 82\\\\%. The ML model is utilized by an ensemble model that is composed of six classifiers namely Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF). The highest accuracy gained with the ensemble model is 100\\\\% which outperforms each individual classifier. However, the system will be efficient for real-time farm automation and cultivation in the mushroom industry.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision farming aims to optimizing the crop production process and managing sustainable supply chain practices as more efficient and reasonable as possible. Recently, various advanced technologies, such as deep-learning and internet of things (IoT), have achieved remarkable intelligence progress in realistic agricultural conditions. However, crops species recognition can be considered as fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) problem, suffering the low inter-class discrepancy and high intra-class variances from the subordinate categories, which is more challenging than common basic-level category classification depended on traditional deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper presents a fine-grained visual recognition model named as MCF-Net to classifying different crop species in practical farmland scenes. Proposed MCF-Net is consisted of cross stage partial network (CSPNet) as backbone module, three parallel sub-networks, and cross-level fusion module. With multi-stream hybrid architecture utilizing massive fine-granulometric information, MCF-Net obtains preferable representation ability for distinguishing interclass discrepancy and tolerating intra-class variances. In addition, the end-to-end implementation of MCF-Net is optimized by cross-level fusion strategy to accurately identify different crop categories. Several experiments on in-field CropDeepv2 datasets demonstrate that our method favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. The recognition accuracy and F1-score of MCF-Net achieves very competitive results up to 90.6\\\\% and 0.962 separately, both of which outperforming contrasted models indicate better recognition accuracy and model stability of our method. Moreover, the overall parameters of MCF-Net are only 807 MByte with achieving a good balance between model’s performance and complexity. It is acceptable and suitable to the implementation of IoT platforms in precision agricultural practices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision agriculture, driven by advancements in sensing technologies and data analytics, offers promising solutions for addressing challenges in paddy disease management. Paddy diseases have significant detrimental effects on crop yield and quality, necessitating timely and accurate detection for effective disease management. Deep learning has shown promise in identifying plant diseases from leaf images, including those in paddy crops. However, the presence of slight variations among different types of paddy diseases poses a significant generalizability challenge. In this study, for the first time, we introduce a lesion-aware visual transformer for accurate and reliable detection of paddy leaf diseases through identifying discriminatory lesion features. A Novel multi-scale contextual feature extraction network is presented to enable capturing a contextual local and global representation of disease features at different scales and channels. Then, a weakly supervised Paddy Lesion Localization (PLL) unit was presented to locate distinctive lesions in paddy leaves that provide the model with discriminative leaf regions that can guide the final classification decision. A feature tuning unit is presented to empower modeling the relations within the global and local latent spaces, thereby improving the spatial exchanges between visual semantics of paddy leaves. The exhaustive experimental comparison against state-of-the-art solutions on public paddy disease datasets demonstrated the efficiency and versatility of our system with an average of 98.74\\\\% accuracy and 98.18\\\\% f1-score.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aquaculture involves cultivating various marine and freshwater aquatic creatures within regulated environments. Monitoring the aquatic environmental conditions in real-time is crucial for successful fish farming. The Internet of Things (IoT) offers significant potential for real-time monitoring, and this paper introduces an IoT framework designed for efficient monitoring and effective control of various water-related aquatic environmental parameters. The proposed system is implemented as an embedded system utilizing sensors and an Arduino microcontroller. In cultivating pond water, diverse sensors such as pH, temperature, and turbidity sensors are deployed, with each sensor connected to an Arduino Uno-based microcontroller board. These sensors collect data from the water, which is then stored as a CSV file in an IoT cloud platform called ThingSpeak through the Arduino microcontroller. To gather data for analysis, we conducted measurements across five ponds, varying in size and environmental conditions. After getting the real-time data, we compared our experimental results with the standard reference values. As a result, we could take the decision of whether a pond is suitable for cultivating fish or not. After that, we labeled the data with 11 fish categories: Katla, sing, prawn, shrimp, rui, tilapia, pangas, karpio, magur, silver carp, and koi. The data was analyzed using 10 machine learning (ML) algorithms, including J48, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), K*, Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), Jumping Rule Inference with Pruned Search (JRIP), Partial Decision Trees (PART), Decision Table, and Logit boost. After experimental analyses, it was discovered that only three of the five ponds were ideal for fish farming, and those three ponds only met the required standards for pH, Temperature, Turbidity, and Conductivity. Among the state-of-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest achieved the highest score of performance metrics as accuracy 94.42\\\\%, kappa statistics 93.5\\\\%, and Avg. TP Rate 94.4\\\\%. In addition, we calculated the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for one scenario.

       "  'abstract': 'Precision Agriculture (PA) promises to meet the future demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel while keeping their production sustainable and environmentally friendly. PA relies heavily on sensing technologies to inform site-specific decision supports for planting, irrigation, fertilization, spraying, and harvesting. Traditional point-based sensors enjoy small data sizes but are limited in their capacity to measure plant and canopy parameters. On the other hand, imaging sensors can be powerful in measuring a wide range of these parameters, especially when coupled with Artificial Intelligence. The challenge, however, is the lack of computing, electric power, and connectivity infrastructure in agricultural fields, preventing the full utilization of imaging sensors. This paper reported AICropCAM, a field-deployable imaging framework that integrated edge image processing, Internet of Things (IoT), and LoRaWAN for low-power, long-range communication. The core component of AICropCAM is a stack of four Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) models running sequentially: CropClassiNet for crop type classification, CanopySegNet for canopy cover quantification, PlantCountNet for plant and weed counting, and InsectNet for insect identification. These DCNN models were trained and tested with {\\\\textgreater}43,000 field crop images collected offline. AICropCAM was embodied on a distributed wireless sensor network with its sensor node consisting of an RGB camera for image acquisition, a Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer for edge image processing, and an Arduino MKR1310 for LoRa communication and power management. Our testing showed that the time to run the DCNN models ranged from 0.20 s for InsectNet to 20.20 s for CanopySegNet, and power consumption ranged from 3.68 W for InsectNet to 5.83 W for CanopySegNet. The classification model CropClassiNet reported 94.5 \\\\% accuracy, and the segmentation model CanopySegNet reported 92.83 \\\\% accuracy. The two object detection models PlantCountNet and InsectNet reported mean average precision of 0.69 and 0.02 for the test images. Predictions from the DCNN models were transmitted to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for visualization and analytics. We concluded that AICropCAM successfully implemented image processing on the edge, drastically reduced the amount of data being transmitted, and could satisfy the real-time need for decision-making in PA. AICropCAM can be deployed on moving platforms such as center pivots or drones to increase its spatial coverage and resolution to support crop monitoring and field operations.',\n",

The proposed detection system is mainly based on a modified mixed depthwise convolutional network (MixConvNet) as a recent deep learning classifier.

The classification results showed that our proposed MixConvNet is efficient and superior to other deep learning classifiers, such as Xception and residual network (Resnet) models in previous related studies, obtaining the best accuracy score of 97.38. Moreover, the MixConvNet classifier is capable of identifying RPW infestation cases precisely with a high accuracy value of 95.90\\\\% ± 1.46, using 10-fold cross-validation.

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture is an essential source of sustenance. Here, pest detection is very helpful in increasing food quality, and also it helps to increase the country’s economy. Moreover, the rapid infestation of pests and insects may face a serious problem in agricultural yield. In existing works, the images are collected from the IoT sensors for pest detection and classification, but it is not satisfactory to acquire higher results regarding accuracy. To solve this issue, a novel pest detection and classification model is suggested. The major intention of the developed method is to detect and identify pests over crops using an object detection model and enhanced classifier. Initially, the IoT platform is included, where the required data is garnered through agriculture-based IoT sensors. The input images are garnered and fed into the subsequent object detection process. Pest detection is obtained through an optimized Yolov3 model. Here, the hidden neurons are optimized by the Adaptive Energy-based Harris Hawks Optimization (AE-HHO) algorithm. The detected pest images are given to the feature extraction process. The deep feature extraction is utilized with the help of Residual Network50 (ResNet50) and Visual Geometry Group16 (VGG16) models. Then, the classification is performed by Weight Optimized Deep Neural Network (WO-DNN) model. Consequently, the WO-DNN of the weight factor is optimized using the AE-HHO algorithm. Finally, the classified outcome is predicted by the AE-HHO algorithm. Hence, the performance is validated with several measures and compared with existing detection methods. Throughout the analysis, the accuracy and F1-score of the designed method attained 96\\\\% and 84\\\\%. Thus, the results explore that the suggested method proves better efficiency in pest detection and classification.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The infestation of litchi stink bugs (Tessaratoma papillosa) has always had a significant impact on the yield of longan plantations. Pest control is critical for farmers to detect and timely suppress the occurrence of pests while effectively reducing damages. Environmental factors, climate change in particular, have contributed to the growing population of pests whereas weather can vary in different terrains, locations, and time. Due to the geographical and topographical conditions of Taiwan, this study focuses on investigating fruit plantations on sloping land in subtropics with distinct seasonal changes. The article aims at forecasting meteorological data based on Long short-term memory network (LSTM) and identifying the correlation between pest infestation and environmental factors through Machine Learning (ML). In this section, the structure and experimental process of the research will be outlined. At the first stage, meteorological information of the experimented site is obtained through the self-designed IoT (Internet of Things) system and wireless long-distance transmission technology. Since meteorological information forecasted is displayed in time series, multi-layer LSTM and bidirectional LSTM are used to solve the problem. Finally, environmental data and field surveys conducted for pest surveillance will be employed to forecast the severity of pest infestation through KNN, SVM, and random forest models. The result of the experiment shows that LSTM performs well in weather forecasting with 96\\\\% R-Squared values whereas the accuracy rate of pest prediction conducted by Machine Learning (ML) is 85\\\\%. The study verifies that meteorological factors do affect pest incidence. For example, the population of litchi stink bugs increase easily under suitable temperature, humidity, and sunlight. LSTM is superior in providing solutions for long-range dependence in statistics. This article shall present regions with shifting weather patterns, meteorological conditions and time length forecasted corresponding to the oceanic climate, as well as the correlation between pest population and environmental factors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Identification of leaf disorder plays an important role in the economic prosperity of any country. Many parts of a plant can be infected by a virus, fungal, bacteria, and other infectious organisms but here we mainly considered the detection of leaf disease of a plant as a research topic. We have performed an in-depth study of this topic from 2010 to 2022 and found that many researchers use multispectral or hyperspectral imaging to study crop diseases. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are used to classify different types of leaf diseases. We made a workflow mechanism to help researchers in this field. Support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest, and multiple twin SVM (MTSVM) are popular ML models for predicting leaf disease, while convolutional neural networks (CNN), visual geometry group (VGG), ResNet (RNet), GoogLeNet, deep CNN (DCNN), back propagation neural networks (BPNN), DenseNet (DNet), LeafNet (LN), and LeNet are common deep learning models used for detecting leaf disease. Among these deep learning models, it is evident that models like CNN, VGG, and ResNet are highly capable at finding diseases in leaves. The performance of the algorithms is generally evaluated using F1 score, precision, accuracy and others. This review will be helpful for the researchers who are working in this area and looking for various efficient ML and DL-based classifiers for leaf disease detection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diseases on maize crops are highly caused by chronic and emerging pathogens that results in stagnant growth in the plant system. Several initiatives have been adopted to manage disease on crops which include new cultivation practices, genetic engineering, plant breeding and chemical control which have only proven to perform better on laboratory-based approaches. Meanwhile, small holder farmers can hardly afford such intervention mechanisms because they are costly and require highly skilled labor. With the advancement of technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) and different artificial intelligence models, non-visual signs of disease are being explored and experimented in this work for nonvisual early disease detection purposes. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Ultrasound, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium (NPK) fertilizer are profiled on control maize and inoculated maize with Exserohilum turcicum fungus to generate time series data. Dataset generated are preprocessed, analyzed, and visualized using pandas and matplotlib python tools. Machine Learning algorithms have been inferenced on the dataset; Statsmodel for trends and seasonality detection and Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) for change point detection. Analysis of data on the implemented Internet of Things technology in this experiment has achieved nonvisual detection of Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) disease on maize within four days post inoculation from monitored Volatile Organic Compounds and ultrasound emission.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for safeguarding crop yield, especially in regions vulnerable to food insecurity, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. One of the significant contributors to maize crop yield loss is the Northern Leaf Blight (NLB), which traditionally takes 14–21 days to visually manifest on maize. This study introduces a novel approach for detecting NLB as early as 4–5 days using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, which can identify the disease before any visual symptoms appear. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, nonvisual measurements of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and ultrasound emissions from maize plants were captured and analyzed. A controlled experiment was conducted on four maize varieties, and the data obtained were used to develop and validate a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for VOC classification and an LSTM model for ultrasound anomaly detection. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model, enhanced with wavelet data preprocessing, achieved an F1 score of 0.96 and an Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 1.00. In contrast, the LSTM model exhibited an impressive 99.98\\\\% accuracy in identifying anomalies in ultrasound emissions. Our findings underscore the potential of IoT sensors in early disease detection, paving the way for innovative disease prevention strategies in agriculture. Future work will focus on optimizing the models for IoT device deployment, incorporating chatbot technology, and more sensor data will be incorporated for improved accuracy and evaluation of the models in a field environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Automatic crop disease recognition in the wild is a challenging topic in modern intelligent agriculture due to the appearance variances and cluttered background among crop diseases. To overcome these obstacles, the popular methods are to design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that extracts visual features and identifies crop disease images based on these features. These methods work well on laboratory environment under simple background but achieve low accuracy and poor robustness in processing the raw images captured from practical fields that contain inevitable noises. In this case, Internet of Things (IoT) is attracting increasing attention, with many alternatives to collect high-level contextual information that helps modern recognition system to effectively identify crop diseases in the wild. Motivated by the usefulness of agricultural IoT, a deep learning system using a novel approach named Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN), is developed to be deployed in agricultural IoT towards practical crop disease recognition in the wild. Our MCFN firstly adopts a standard CNN backbone to extract highly discriminative and robust visual features from over 50,000 in-field crop disease samples. Next, we exploit contextual features collected from image acquisition sensors as prior information to assist crop disease classification and reduce false positives in our presented ContextNet. Finally, a deep fully connected network is designed to fuse visual features as well as contextual features and output the crop disease prediction. Experimental results on 77 common crop diseases captured in our newly built domain specific dataset show that MCFN with the deep fusion model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in wild crop disease recognition, and achieves a good identification accuracy of 97.5\\\\%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Machine learning (ML) can make use of agricultural data related to crop yield under varying soil nutrient levels, and climatic fluctuations to suggest appropriate crops or supplementary nutrients to achieve the highest possible production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of five distinct ML models for a dataset sourced from the Kaggle repository to generate practical recommendations for crop selection or determination of required nutrient(s) in a given site. The datasets contain information on NPK, soil pH, and three climatic variables: temperature, rainfall, and humidity. The models namely Support vector machine, XGBoost, Random forest, KNN, and Decision Tree were trained using yields of individual data sets of 11 agricultural and 10 horticultural crops, as well as combined yield of both agri-horticultural crops. The results strongly suggest to evaluate individual data sets separately for each crop category rather than using combined the data sets of both categories for better predictions. Comparing the five ML models, the XGBoost demonstrated the highest level of accuracy. The precision rates of XGBoost for recommending agricultural crops, horticultural crops, and a combination of both were 99.09 \\\\% (AUC 1.0), 99.3 \\\\% (AUC 1.0), and 98.51 \\\\% (AUC 0.99), respectively.

       "  'abstract': 'Oil palms are one of the essential crops in agricultural productivity for developing countries such as Malaysia and other tropical areas. For predicting the yield and production of palm oil, the counting process is often carried out. Manually counting oil palm trees is one of the solutions but it requires a massive labour force, and the result is often inaccurate. To overcome this problem, automated techniques for oil palm detection have been developed. However, the performance of existing automated techniques for oil palm detection deteriorates when the planting layout of the oil palm tree is not well organized. Deep learning applications for oil palm tree detection and counting offer a powerful solution to the challenges of precision agriculture, enabling plantations to increase productivity and sustainability while reducing costs and manual labour. Deep structured learning, more generally deep learning is one of the widely used computer vision technology, especially in agricultural engineering. Deep learning method is an essential tool when it comes to monitoring the plantation. Different deep learning networks are utilized for classification tasks towards oil palm trees. In order to promote the use of deep learning in the oil palm industry, this paper main contribution is to provide an understanding of the utilisation of deep learning and its application in oil palm tree counting. The gaps and opportunities for research in oil palm plantations based on deep learning techniques will also be discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The creation of smart greenhouses is playing a crucial role in paving the way toward precision agriculture characterized by enhanced efficiency. Integral to these greenhouses are decision-support systems that leverage sophisticated forecasting algorithms to predict a range of parameters. However, these predictors often employ a single model approach for forecasting all variables of interest, leading to imbalanced predictions where some variables are accurately predicted while others do not. Such inconsistencies can undermine the overall reliability of the decision-support systems. Addressing this challenge, this paper proposes an approach that harnesses the potential of multiple deep-learning models operating concurrently to predict a broad array of environmental parameters within a smart and operational greenhouse. Each model is specifically tailored to concentrate on a distinct subset of target variables, thus ensuring that the overall accuracy of the prediction is optimized. The effectiveness of this approach has been evaluated in a real-world greenhouse setting. The results indicate a substantial improvement, exhibiting more than an 8\\\\% enhancement in the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to a single-model alternative, particularly in predicting specific environmental variables, confirming the potential for more reliable and precise agricultural decision-support systems.',\n",

Therefore, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems supported by artificial intelligence technologies can be developed to help diagnose diseases quickly and accurately by examining the symptoms and signs in plant leaves. In this study, Multi-head Attention Mechanism Depthwise Separable Convolution Inception Reduction Network (MDSCIRNet) architecture, an image-based deep convolutional neural network, is proposed for classifying potato leaf diseases. The main components of the MDSCIRNet architecture are depthwise separable convolution (DSC) and a multi-head attention mechanism. The proposed architecture has been compared with modern algorithms developed with DSC technology, such as Xception, MobileNet, and deep learning algorithms, such as ResNet101, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB2, to evaluate its performance in the classification process. In addition, hybrid methods developed with the classical machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and MDSCIRNet model, integrated deep learning model, hard voting ensemble learning model. Suggested methods such as these were also used in the experimental process. Moreover, techniques such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN), and Hypercolumn were used to improve the image quality of the data set. In the experimental process, the MDSCIRNet deep learning architecture achieved 99.24\\\\% accuracy in the study using the original dataset. While a 99.11\\\\% accuracy rate was achieved with the integrated deep learning model and hard voting ensemble learning model, the highest success rate of 99.33\\\\% was performed in the study conducted with the MDSCIRNet + SVM method. This study contributes to developing new and effective strategies in the agricultural industry for the early diagnosis and control of potato plant diseases.

However, pests destroy a significant portion of the harvest and reduce quality; thus, farmers struggle to discover pests on their farms. Traditional pest identification methods require scientists with extensive field experience correctly identify pests based on their physical characteristics. Pesticides harm food and agriculture. IoT technology uses many affordable sensor devices to collect real-time data on pest-related agricultural development characteristics. The research paper aims to develop an AI-enabled real-time, IoT-based automatic pest detection system using sound pest analytics and IoT networks in the sizeable agricultural field. The proposed method used audio pre-processing techniques in sound analytics such as HPF, Hann window, hop window, FFT, DFT, STFT, and MFCC algorithm for denoising the pest sound, removing the spectral leakage, converting overlapping to non-overlapping frames, converting the time to the frequency domain, determining frequency spectrum, detecting sinusoidal frequency and internal component, extracting the MFCCs feature respectively. The characteristics and other statistical metrics were collected from 500 pest sounds and trained, validated, and evaluated using the CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and CNN-Bi-LSTM network models. The extracting features and different statistical measurements were compared during the testing process. The proposed system integrated the CNN and Bi-LSTM techniques called CNN-Bi-LSTM model for training, validating, and testing. From the experimental results, it has been observed that, the proposed CNN-Bi-LSTM model achieved 98.91 \\\\% accuracy, 96.8 \\\\% sensitivity, 97.96 \\\\% specificity, 98.54 \\\\% recall, 98.63 \\\\% precision, and 98.58 \\\\% F1 score, which is better compared to CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM and also existing ANN, DCNN, and VGG-16 state-of-the-art techniques.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the era of Big data, data-driven farming is changing the agricultural businesses thanks to the use of modern technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, drones, and farm monitoring. IoT devices produce a massive amount of precious agri-data, which are collected and analyzed in real-time using innovative application tools. This combination of technology, known as “Smart farming”, helps various stakeholders in the agri-ecosystem to monitor crops in real-time, as well as maximize productivity and profitability in farm and business operations with the minimum efforts. Although many Smart farming solutions have been introduced, both from industry and academia, universal applicability of these approaches for other farms, unfortunately, is not feasible. Most of these solutions are based on a home-made non-standard Big data processing architecture. In this paper, we propose WALLeSMART, a cloud-based Smart farming management system, applied to the Wallonia region of Belgium. The framework introduces a general architecture to address the challenges of acquisition, processing, storing, and visualization of very large amounts of data, both in batch and real-time basis. An initial prototype has been developed and tested with various farms showing prominent results.',\n",

Agriculture is the primary source of economic income in Bangladesh and the country's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture. The soil and water resources of our country are fertile and the climate is moderate. But numerous diseases affect crop production and cause enormous crop losses, endangering the lives of helpless farmers. A previous report showed that about 70–80\\\\% of cotton diseases were leaf diseases and 30–20\\\\% were pest diseases. Experts typically use bare eyes to find and identify such plant diseases and pests which may result from lower accuracy of the identification. As a result, early detection of cotton disease using AI-based systems may help to increase the production of cotton by detecting the leaf disease significantly. In this research, we proposed a DL-based cotton leaf disease detection approach using fine-tuning Transfer Learning (TL) algorithms by tuning the layers and parameters of the existing TL algorithms. We also investigated the performance of several fine-tuning TL models such as VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3 and Xception on the publicly available cotton dataset for cotton disease prediction. The investigations found that the Xception model provides the highest accuracy rate of 98.70\\\\% and was selected to develop a web-based smart application for real-life cotton disease prediction in farming to increase cotton production. Hence, our model can accurately diagnose cotton leaf diseases and will provide a new window for the automatic leaf disease diagnosis of other plants.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Due to low labor participation by young adults and an aging agricultural population, Taiwan and the rest of the world are facing labor shortages in agriculture, which will affect aquaculture production. The proposed system is intended primarily for solving the problems faced by the aquaculture farming sector in Taiwan by designing a smart IoT-based fish monitoring and control system equipped with different IoT devices to enable real-time data collection; so that fishpond water-quality conditions and other system parameters can be readily monitored, adjusted, and assessed remotely. To predict the growth of the California Bass fish, this study also develops a deep learning model (DL) that correlates the different parameters of the smart aquaculture system. Bayesian optimization-based hyper-parameter tuning was employed to find the optimal DL model configuration to produce accurate predictions on the given experimental data set. The optimal model produces an R2 value of 0.94 and a mean square error of 0.0015, demonstrating the applicability of the model to predict the desired output. Based on the results of the experiments, the DL model can be incorporated into the autonomous feeding system, reducing the amount of leftover feed. Thus, aquaculture based on the artificial intelligence of things (AIOT) can assist fish farmers in intelligently controlling and managing different fishpond equipment remotely and assist aquaculture operators in performing professional aquaculture, lowering the industry's entry barrier, and promoting aquaculture.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agricultural pests cause between 20 and 40 percent loss of global crop production every year as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Therefore, smart agriculture presents the best option for farmers to apply artificial intelligence techniques integrated with modern information and communication technology to eliminate these harmful insect pests. Consequently, the productivity of their crops can be increased. Hence, this article introduces a new mobile application to automatically classify pests using a deep-learning solution for supporting specialists and farmers. The developed application utilizes faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) to accomplish the recognition task of insect pests based on cloud computing. Furthermore, a database of recommended pesticides is linked with the detected crop pests to guide the farmers. This study has been successfully validated on five groups of pests; called Aphids, Cicadellidae, Flax Budworm, Flea Beetles, and Red Spider. The proposed Faster R-CNN showed highest accurate recognition results of 99.0\\\\% for all tested pest images. Moreover, our deep learning method outperforms other previous recognition methods, i.e., Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD) MobileNet and traditional back propagation (BP) neural networks. The main prospect of this study is to realize our developed application for on-line recognition of agricultural pests in both the open field such as large farms and greenhouses for specific crops.',\n",

At any time between crop farming, plant diseases can affect the leaf, resulting in enormous crop production damages and economic market value. Therefore, in the farming industry, identification of leaf disease plays a crucial role. It needs, however, enormous labor, greater preparation time, and comprehensive plant pathogen knowledge. For the identification of plant disease detection various machine learning (ML) as well as deep learning (DL) methods are developed \\\\& examined by various researchers, and many of the times they also got significant results in both cases.

The results demonstrated that the AE neural network for spectral correction was effective in eliminating differences between devices and significantly reducing the impact of different detection terminals on the accuracy of NIR detection of SSC in apples.

       "  'abstract': 'Mortality is an important production and fish welfare indicator in aquaculture. Unusual mortality patterns can be associated with abiotic or/and biotic stresses on fish in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Real or near real-time mortality tracking can provide valuable inputs to farm managers, to make informed RAS management decisions and address root causes in an effort to prevent mass mortality events. While traditional systems use infrequent human operator observation and tracking - often in conjunction with an underwater camera - the proposed tool (i.e., ‘MortCam’) augments this approach with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) deployed at the Edge to provide round-the-clock mortality monitoring and trigger alerts when mortality thresholds are exceeded. MortCam consists of an imaging sensor integrated with an edge computing device, customized for underwater applications. MortCam was deployed in a 150 m3 circular dual-drain RAS tank at 0.6 m above the bottom drain plate to acquire the imagery data in both ambient and supplemental light conditions. The images were collected every fifteen minutes for 90 days. Acquired images were annotated either as ‘alive’ or ‘dead’ fish and split into training (70 \\\\%), validation (20 \\\\%), and test (10 \\\\%) datasets to train a custom YOLOv7 mortality detection model. The optimized mixed model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) and F1 score of 93.4 \\\\% and 0.89, respectively. Additionally, the model performed well in terms of mortality count and was found robust despite changes in the imaging conditions. The model was deployed on the MortCam to achieve round-the-clock autonomous mortality monitoring. The system reliably generated email and text alerts to notify fish production staff of unusual mortality events.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Nowadays, artificial intelligence and sensor technology play a vital role in the agriculture field. The use of excess insecticides and fertilizers in farming poses a risk to human health. It is necessary to control them to ensure healthy crop production. Many techniques are used to identify the pest, suggest medications, and do soil nutrient analysis techniques separately. This paper applies the dual operator, Transition Probability Function (TPF), and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to process the pest's image discretely and continuously for applying the recommended insecticide. The mathematical model with the objective function is derived in this paper. The proposed system combines two major aspects in farming: pest identification and insecticide recommendation using machine vision and CNN. Secondly, the soil nutrient analysis uses a soil NPK sensor with the recommendation of fertilizers according to the obtained nutrient values. On-spot results are obtained, and the time required for insecticide recommendation is within 10 s, and for fertilizer recommendation, it is within 80 s. Successful identification of five pests, namely aphids, bollworms, leaf folder, leaf miner, and green stink bug, was done with more than 90\\\\% accuracy. The proposed approach is also compared with the other intelligent approaches, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and it is observed that the proposed TPF-CNN approach gives higher accuracy in the shortest time.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision agriculture control systems count on reliable and accurate microclimate forecasts to maintain environmental suitability for crop growth. However, IoT devices adopted to monitor microclimate are expensive to people in developing countries. This study proposed a hybrid deep learning model (ConvLSTM*CNN-BP) without using IoT data to produce accurate multi-horizon and multi-factor (greenhouse internal temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation) forecasts simultaneously. The proposed model fused a convolutional-based long short term memory neural network (ConvLSTM), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). Model construction involved an ensemble of gridded 6-hour-ahead meteorological forecasts from the STMAS-WRF model and 3-hour-ahead greenhouse internal temperature simulated by a physically-based model at a 10-min scale. Another deep learning model (CNN*LSTM*Stacked LSTM-BP) using IoT data was established for comparison purpose. The experimental results on two greenhouses located in Central Taiwan indicated that the proposed model (non-IoT) and the benchmark model (with IoT) produced similar forecast performances on greenhouse internal temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation. Moreover, the proposed model with illustrious abilities of noise removal and feature extraction could provide satisfactory forecast accuracy. The proposed deep learning approach hits a milestone in multi-horizon and multi-factor forecasting on microclimate, which significantly supports farmers, especially in developing countries, in reducing the installation and maintenance costs of IoT devices for monitoring purpose.',\n",

Monitoring in terms of detection and counting palm trees provides useful information for a variety of stakeholders; it helps in yield estimation and examination to ensure better crop quality and prevent pests, diseases, better irrigation and other potential threats. Despite their importance, these information still difficult to obtain. In this study, we systematically review research articles between 2011 and 2021 on artificial intelligence (AI) technology for smart palm tree detection. A systematic review (SR) was performed using the PRISMA approach based on a four-stage selection process. Twenty-two articles were included for the synthesis activity reached from the search strategy alongside the inclusion criteria in order to answer tow two main research questions. The study's findings reveal patterns, relationships, networks, and trends in the application of artificial intelligence in the palm tree detection over the last decade. Overall, despite the good results achieved in most of the studies, the effective and efficient management of large-scale palm plantations still a challenge.

Peru is considered one of the major producers and exporters of this product, being the city of Piura the main region with most of the national agro-producers. It is also considered a key factor in the development of the economy of this region as it creates job opportunities because of the productive chain required in the process (harvest, post-harvest, and export). The main problem faced by producers is the existence of pests such as Red spot thrips, Black Sigatoka, and others, which affect the production and the quality of the final product.

Precision livestock farming (PLF) is a key step to achieve the sustainable development of smart farms, but it is still in the initial stage and has broad prospects. In order to realize precise livestock production, it is necessary to speed up the popularization of intelligent technologies such as environmental control, disease early warning, precise feeding and remote diagnosis. By analyzing the background and technical features of wearable Internet of Things (W-IoT), this paper puts forward a new scheme of applying W-IoT to PLF. Through the detailed survey of the related research on W-IoT and PLF, we believe that precise perception of information, biocompatibility of wearable devices, and sustainability monitoring of wearable systems are necessary contents. However, most wearable technologies that can generate precise, dynamic and sustainable signals are only applicable to humans, and rarely modified or tested specifically for farm animals. At present, these innovative technologies are gradually promoted to livestock farming, which are expected to become one of the most effective solutions for PLF in smart farms. In addition, this paper also discusses the benefits, challenges and prospects of the W-IoT in farm animals.',\n",

Early and efficient detection of aphid colonies enables the implementation of control measures to reduce crop damage. Aphid colonies exhibit different shapes, sizes, and numbers of individuals, and their distribution makes it hard to detect them correctly. This paper investigates machine learning-based aphid colony detection from imagery. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study that uses artificial intelligence-based computing algorithms to detect aphid colonies from images. As such, no aphid colony image dataset is currently available publicly. To mitigate this, we have relabelled an existing insect and pest dataset and repurposed it as an aphid colony dataset (AphColDat). For labelling, first, we automatically identify the regions of interest for colonies based on the locations and distributions of aphids. A novel bounding box merging technique is proposed to generate regions potential colony boxes. These colony boxes are a collection of single or overlapping aphid boxes that co-locate together in a colony. Once the dataset is constructed, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classification algorithm is applied to the images to create AphColDat. This paper evaluates several object detecting deep learning models on the newly developed dataset. The results demonstrate mean average precisions (mAP) of 56.9\\\\%, 53.4\\\\%, 53.1\\\\%, and 48.7\\\\% respectively by Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and EfficientNet. In terms of average detection speed (computational time), SSD and EfficientNet are faster than Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Input optimization is a distinguishing characteristic of Precision Agriculture approaches, helping reduce the environmental impact and costs and increase vegetable production quality. Thanks to the high automation evolution of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), a new approach derived from their combination with Deep Learning techniques is leading to significant improvements in agricultural management practices. The study aims at artichoke plants detection and georeferencing as a first step for an on-the-fly, real time, UAS spraying system, and use the gathered information to monitor crop development through a multi-temporal approach. A commercial UAS, equipped with an RGB sensor, acquired images of the artichoke field located in Sardinia (Italy) during the 2021–2022 season in different crop growth stages. The FPN (Feature Pyramid Network), trained and compared with the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) network, showed a high detection level with an average F1 score of around 90\\\\%, and satisfactory off-line performances on the Nvidia Jetson Nano board. YOLOv5 achieved the best overall result. The FPN recorded a lower recall, which is desirable to achieve a minimum number of detection errors and limit the leakage of agrochemicals on false-positive targets. The multi-temporal approach influenced detection performances, with an inverse response of precision and recall metrics. The growing index trend showed a distinct value in October, peaking at the beginning of December as expected. The proposed approach contributes to designing future automatic and reliable site-specific UAS agrochemicals application and the classification of management zones.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Mushrooms are popular food items containing numerous vitamins, dietary fibers, and a large number of proteins. As a result, mushrooms can increase the body’s immunity and prevent many types of cancer to keep the body healthy. For these reasons, the demand for high yields and safety in the production of high-quality mushrooms is increasing. Scope and approach This review highlights the application of computer vision and machine learning algorithms in the mushroom industry. Through a systematic review of papers published between 1991 and 2021, this article introduces key aspects related to mushrooms (e.g., species identification and quality classification based on artificial intelligence), and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches. Key findings and conclusions Numerous artificial intelligence and machine vision technologies have been implemented in research efforts focusing on edible fungi. However, their applications are generally limited to the identification of poisonous mushrooms according to their forms, the plucking of cultivated mushrooms covered by soil, and the mechanized grading of mushrooms. Clearly, the currently available methods cannot meet the requirements of the digitization and intelligentization in the field of edible mushrooms. Considering these reasons, it is possible to develop further application opportunities, such as digital mushroom phenotype determination, and high-throughput breeding based on big data, and mechanical picking by a harvesting robot as well. Therefore, the integration of computer vision and machine learning with the development of more efficient algorithms will undoubtedly be a hotspot for future studies in the context of the mushroom industry.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture plays an imperative role in many countries’ economies and is a substantive source of survival. The variation in a soil nutrient decreases crop yield. An accurate soil fertility classification and application of fertilizers are essential for enhancing crop productivity. Currently, soil fertility levels are assessed through laboratory testing of soil samples, and fertilizers are applied randomly. This traditional practice increases fertilization costs and causes environmental pollution. Thus, it is necessary to develop robust and inexpensive soil fertility classification and fertilizer application. This study identifies the machine learning (ML) or deep learning-based soil fertility classifications. A comprehensive review is conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The purpose of this study is to examine different approaches that researchers use to predict or classify soil fertility. It also discusses the fertilizer recommendation developed by the researchers. The earlier research showed that ML-based approaches could accurately classify soil fertility. Furthermore, this study discusses the importance of soil nutrients and preventive measures to be taken on the imbalance of soil nutrients. This study explores research gaps and challenges in soil fertility classification and fertilizer recommendation systems. Most studies predicted the fertility levels of soil parameters, whereas a few researchers classified soil fertility. Few researchers recommended fertilizers for soil nutrient depletion. Most studies relied on expensive laboratory measurements or regional soil data collected from satellites. Based on the identified research gaps, this study suggests potential future research possibilities in soil fertility classification and the recommendation of fertilizers. It aims to develop a low-cost soil fertility classifier to prescribe fertilizers. The developed model can help farmers to enhance soil fertility with reduced fertilization costs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Globally, all the major crops are significantly affected by diseases every year, as manual inspection across diverse fields is time-consuming, tedious, and requires expert knowledge. This leads to significant crop loss in different parts of the world. To provide effective solutions, several smart agriculture solutions are deployed for the control of pests and plant diseases using vision-based machine learning techniques. Despite rapid growth in the field, not many methods have been explored for their suitability in real-time applications. Several open challenges need to be addressed for the applicability of machine learning techniques in IoT-based smart agriculture solutions. Starting from data capturing methods and the availability of public datasets, the present paper provides a comprehensive review of vision-based machine learning techniques for plant disease detection. Initially, 1337 articles were selected from various scholarly resources to perform the survey. Based on the saliency of approaches, 148 articles are reviewed in this paper. Interestingly, a significant amount of research in this direction is taken up by Chinese and Indian researchers, and deep learning is the current research trend, as in other fields. The review concludes that a majority of existing methods exhibit their efficacy on public datasets captured mostly in controlled environmental conditions, but their generalization capability for in-field plant disease detection has not been explored. Lightweight CNN-based methods, on the other hand, have been designed for a limited number of diseases only, and are generally trained on small datasets. The scarcity of large-scale, in-field public datasets is one of the major bottlenecks in developing solutions that can work for a wide variety of plant diseases.',\n",

The current study evaluated the performance of different artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and their ensembles in forecasting Crop Evapotranspiration (ETc) and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) against calculated single crop coefficient FAO56 ETc and Jackson's theoretical CWSI, respectively. Soil moisture, canopy temperatures (Tc) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were all measured from irrigated and non-irrigated maize plots in West Central Nebraska during 2020 and 2021 growing seasons. There were fifteen and twelve input combinations used for ETc and CWSI predictions, respectively, having input variables such as weather and soil moisture as well as ancillary variables, including NDVI, reference evapotranspiration (ETr), and cumulative growing degree days (CGDDs). While evaluating the models, four statistical performance indicators including coefficient of determination (r2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absoluter error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used. Furthermore, ranking scores were performed on statistical results to find the overall best model across all the input combinations. Based on total ranking scores, CatBoost (RMSE ranging between 0.06 – 0.09 unitless) was the best model in predicting CWSI, while Stacked Regression (RMSE ranging between 0.27 – 0.72 mm d−1) was the best model for ETc estimation. Future research will consider designing and evaluating an IDSS using identified best machine learning models to establish soil water and plant stress feedback for automated irrigation scheduling.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"There is a demand for flowers globally all year round, more particularly roses, necessitating increased production for flowers. Demand for roses has increased due to their year-long availability as well as its uses in cosmetic, perfume, medicinal products, food raw materials and decoration industry. Rose plants are prone to drastic fluctuations in temperature, drought stress damages, and low precipitations. These resulted to an increase in greenhouse production to generate optimum supply to meet growing demands as controlled environment provides several advantages. In this study, four machine learning models (random forest, support vector machine, multinomial logistic regression, and artificial neural networks) were applied to roses greenhouse cultivation dataset. The study aims to classify the most suitable greenhouse environment to upgrade the roses state leading to the optimal production of roses. Four model configurations corresponding to the pre-processing techniques were tested. These were scaling only, scaling plus removal of outliers, scaling plus SMOTE, and scaling with removal of outliers plus SMOTE. Random forest with all pre-processing steps applied to the dataset obtained the best performance with the highest weighted F1- scores, weighted-average precision, weighted-average recall, and Cohen's kappa statistic. This indicates that machine learning models can predict corrective actions leading to improved conditions of roses. The notable contribution of this research is to find valid and reliable classification models that assist growers in predicting the best greenhouse micro-environment.\",\n",

According to the quality inspection process, a baby corn with black marks or blemishes is considered a defect or unqualified class which should be discarded. Quality inspection and sorting of agricultural products like baby corn are labor-intensive and time-consuming. The main goal of this work is to develop an automated quality inspection framework to differentiate between ‘pass’ and ‘fail’ categories based on baby corn images. A traditional image processing method using a threshold principle is compared with relatively more advanced deep learning models. Particularly, Convolutional neural networks, specific sub-types of deep learning models, were implemented. Thorough experiments on choices of network architectures and their hyperparameters were conducted and compared. A Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) framework was further utilized for network interpretation purposes. The EfficientNetB5 networks with relatively larger input sizes yielded up to 99.06\\\\% accuracy as the best performance against 95.28\\\\% obtained from traditional image processing. Incorporating a region of interest identification, several model experiments, data application on baby corn images, and the SHAP framework are our main contributions.

       "  'abstract': 'Today, there is a visible reduction in productivity of common crops like rice and wheat in agricultural sector. At the same time, millet crops have emerged as an alternative to counter global food security issues because of their adaptability and nutritional value that can combat malnutrition. Also, because of its low moisture requirement and tolerance to extreme climatic conditions, it is perceived as a stable cereal. But its cultivation is affected by diseases like rust and blast, thereby causing harm to the farming economy. Conventional operational methods of disease detection require regular manual intervention which are also costly. The correctness of expert suggestions is also under scrutiny. Thus, a sustainable, robust and low cost modern approach for millet crop monitoring and disease detection is required. This research aims to develop a smart and sustainable framework by integrating Internet of things (IoT) and deep learning (DL). In the presented framework, a sensory module based automated crop health data gathering system with an improved deep learning-assisted intelligent disease recognition model is developed for the millet crop. Sensors collect data from millet farmland transfer the crop data readings to the cloud server for storage and Raspberry Pi for further detection. Any abnormality in reading leads to an alert notification communicated to the farmer. A hybrid predictive model, Customized Convolutional neural network (Customized-CNN) model works with the Raspberry Pi to predict the presence of blast and rust disease symptoms in millet. The proposed sustainable model is implemented, and it generates productive outcomes. The recorded accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score values with the customized CNN model were 98.8\\\\%, 98.2\\\\%, 97.4\\\\%, and 97.7\\\\%, respectively. The training and testing delays were only 67 s and 88 s, respectively. A sample of yearly sensor readings was generated to show the accuracy and reliability of the model’s data collection. Also, the model proved to be scalable, as it gave noteworthy performance with diverse crops. The evaluation shows the reliability of the model, and it can be used by farming societies to enhance millet cereal yield in a cost-effective way.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Agro-Ecological (AE) zone plays a vital role in determining which crops are suitable for cultivation in specific areas of land. However, changing environmental and climate conditions have made it increasingly difficult for farmers to choose the right crops, resulting in both time and financial losses. Traditional research in this field has struggled with issues like inaccurate predictions, crop variability, diversification, and a high error rate. This research introduces the Inter-fused Machine Learning with Advanced Stacking Ensemble model (IML-ASE) as a solution to improve crop prediction accuracy using AE zone data. The primary goal is to develop the IML-ASE approach, leveraging information about agricultural, environmental, and soil conditions within AE zones to help farmers make knowledgeable decisions about crop selection. The process involves collecting data from crop recommendation datasets, preprocessing it, and feeding it into the proposed model. The advanced stacking model consists of multiple layers, with the first layer using various ensemble techniques as base learners, the second layer acting as a meta-learner, and the third layer serving as the fine learner. This research addresses the challenges faced in modern agriculture by providing farmers with more accurate crop predictions based on AE zone characteristics. Prediction performance is assessed by metrics like mean absolute error, mean square error, root mean square error, accuracy (97.1\\\\%), F1-score (97.09\\\\%), precision (97.03\\\\%), recall (97.12\\\\%), and specificity (100\\\\%), allowing for comparisons across predictions. This advancement aims to empower farmers to make informed decisions and effectively adapt to the everchanging agricultural landscape.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'It is crucial to accurately and timely estimate crop yield within field variability for sustainable management and precision farming applications. Various Earth observation systems have been developed for crop monitoring and yield prediction. However, there is a need for further research that integrates multiplatform data, advances in satellite technology, and data processing to apply this knowledge to agricultural practices. The integration of satellite imagery and environmental data has been used increasingly in recent years to predict crop yields using machine learning techniques. In recent years, VIs derived from optical satellites, particularly Sentinel 2 (S2), have gained popularity, but their availability is affected by weather conditions. On the other hand, the backscatter data from Sentinel 1 (S1) is less commonly used in agriculture due to its complex interpretation and processing, but it is not influenced by the weather. This study aims to improve the accuracy of yield predictions by combining remote sensing data with environmental variables. The use of satellite data S1 and S2 was used to identify the optimal phenological period, and a training model was developed using four machine learning techniques, including Random Forest Regression (RF), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Decision Tree (DT). The results showed that RF provided the highest values among the four techniques. The validation process using RF demonstrated high accuracy rates, with R2 ranging from 0.41 to 0.89, the mean square error of the root (RMSE) ranging from 0.122 to 0.224 t/ha, and the mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.089 to 0.163 t/ha. The integration of satellite data S1 and S2 with topographical information may be useful for monitoring, mapping, and forecasting crop yields on small and fragmented farmlands. This approach can provide farmers, agricultural businesses, and policymakers with accurate and timely predictions of crop yield, which can facilitate decision making and provide early warnings for potential crop losses.',\n",

Precise prediction of crop yield focuses primarily on agriculture research that has a significant effect on making decisions such as import-export, pricing, and distribution of specific crops. There is a severe need to utilize advanced technologies in order to improve yield quality and creation, anticipate crop yields, and study crop diseases/infections. The most prevalent issue among farmers is that they do not select the appropriate crop based on their soil needs. As a result, they see a significant decrease in production. In this paper, we presented a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based crop classification system for precision agriculture selection to solve the farmers' dilemma. DRL-based advanced agriculture techniques eliminate bad options and boost production in the crop recommendation system. We compared the proposed recommendation system with the various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Tree, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor, for a site-specific crop with effective accuracy.\",\n",

Here, the Remora chicken swarm optimization with SqueezeNet (RCSO-based SqueezeNet) is employed for categorizing the root disease. The SqueezeNet training is done using RCSO, which is formed by integrating the Remora optimization algorithm (ROA) and chicken swarm optimization (CSO). This model assists to mine the hidden knowledge from images and attains high accuracy, while classifying the disease present in the roots. Here, IoT is incorporated wherein the IoT nodes help to accumulate the information of roots and sends this information to the base station (BS), wherein the classification of root disease is achieved.

       "  'abstract': \"Timely lameness detection is one of the major and costliest health problems in dairy cattle that farmers and practitioners haven't yet solved adequately. The primary reason behind this is the high initial setup costs, complex equipment and lack of multi-vendor interoperability in currently available solutions. On the other hand, human observation based solutions relying on visual inspections are prone to late detection with possible human error, and are not scalable. This poses a concern with increasing herd sizes, as prolonged or undetected lameness severely compromises cows' health and welfare, and ultimately affects the milk productivity of the farm. To tackle this, we have developed an end-to-end IoT application that leverages advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques to monitor the cattle in real-time and identify lame cattle at an early stage. The proposed approach has been validated on a real world smart dairy farm setup consisting of a dairy herd of 150 cows in Waterford, Ireland. Using long-range pedometers specifically designed for use in dairy cattle, we monitor the activity of each cow in the herd. The accelerometric data from these sensors is aggregated at the fog node to form a time series of behavioral activities, which are further analyzed in the cloud. Our hybrid clustering and classification model identifies each cow as either Active, Normal or Dormant, and further, Lame or Non-Lame. The detected lameness anomalies are further sent to farmer's mobile device by way of push notifications. The results indicate that we can detect lameness 3 days before it can be visually captured by the farmer with an overall accuracy of 87\\\\%. This means that the animal can either be isolated or treated immediately to avoid any further effects of lameness. Moreover, with fog based computational assistance in the setup, we see an 84\\\\% reduction in amount of data transferred to the cloud as compared to the conventional cloud based approach.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The rise of the Internet of Things allowed higher spatial–temporal resolution soil moisture data captured through in situ sensing. Such abundance of data enables machine learning-based soil moisture forecast as an alternative to traditional mechanistic approaches for irrigation water need estimation. This paper develops a guideline for soil moisture forecast modeling based on machine learning, tested in a real case analysis comprehending eight crop types in twelve fields from four farms distributed over diverse climatic scenarios in Brazil. Instead of a single value, we predict the following days' minimum and maximum values as targets to monitor risks of extreme soil moisture values. Furthermore, modeling soil moisture directly in volumetric water content (VWC) is better than modeling soil matric potential (SMP) to later convert in soil moisture VWC. We test several algorithms and find out that LightGBM outperforms linear regression, decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, LSTM, and StemGNN. Also, blending predictions via algorithm ensemble provides an additional accuracy gain. For model training and accuracy measurement, we use weighted datasets to privilege rare but critical data points. We show that soil moisture forecast reaches its maximum performance considering only past soil moisture, a context-aware index, and a precipitation forecast. Finally, we demonstrate that traditional domain-knowledge features - such as evapotranspiration, crop phenology, and soil hydraulic behavior - are not relevant to improving SM forecast performance. Consequently, our paper suggests full data-driven approaches for irrigation water need estimation, observed some care regarding data quality.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As water resources become scarce around the globe, a sustainable irrigation management is essential for increasing the crop use efficiency. Crop EvapoTranspiration (ET) is considered as one of the fundamental variables for correct irrigation management. Current ET prediction models adjust their system parameters: i) during time consuming training cycles; ii) by (destructive) leaf-area measurements; iii) only once during training for a particular meteorological scenario. These parameters are static. They cannot learn over time. On top of that, these models fail when some of the input variables are missing. To overcome these shortcomings, we follow an Internet of Things (IoT) approach to crop water use modeling and prediction for soilless cultivations. First, a stochastic crop coefficient confined to global radiation, Kr, is defined. Then, the evolution of Kr is modeled as state-space system with the daily temperature as input data, and global radiation and crop weight as measurement data. The latter data may also be missing at random. We derive a predictor for the posteriori probability of Kr and show that predicting crop ET via Kr it is immune to propagation of uncertainty over time due to erroneous weather forecasting. Our predictor is implemented in the cloud server of the IoT network. The sensor nodes, connected to a lightweight IoT client, supply our model with information in (soft) real-time. A web interface allows for visualization of the time series in real-time. To discuss Quality of Service (QoS) issues, we model the IoT network as synchronous data flow graph revealing its workflow and timings of the individual nodes. Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is used to test the performance in four climatic environments and two different sampling methods: i) sample daily from the same environment in parallel; ii) sample daily from one environment and move on to the next in round robin fashion, emulating reuse of the same set of measurement equipment at a quarter of the costs. It turns out that in both cases, our Kr-based crop ET predictor outperforms the competing Baille technique. The performance of our IoT network is assessed by means of the QoS metrics response time, jitter, and availability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The first paradigm of plant breeding involves direct selection-based phenotypic observation, followed by predictive breeding using statistical models for quantitative traits constructed based on genetic experimental design and, more recently, by incorporation of molecular marker genotypes. However, plant performance or phenotype (P) is determined by the combined effects of genotype (G), envirotype (E), and genotype by environment interaction (GEI). Phenotypes can be predicted more precisely by training a model using data collected from multiple sources, including spatiotemporal omics (genomics, phenomics, and enviromics across time and space). Integration of 3D information profiles (G-P-E), each with multidimensionality, provides predictive breeding with both tremendous opportunities and great challenges. Here, we first review innovative technologies for predictive breeding. We then evaluate multidimensional information profiles that can be integrated with a predictive breeding strategy, particularly envirotypic data, which have largely been neglected in data collection and are nearly untouched in model construction. We propose a smart breeding scheme, integrated genomic-enviromic prediction (iGEP), as an extension of genomic prediction, using integrated multiomics information, big data technology, and artificial intelligence (mainly focused on machine and deep learning). We discuss how to implement iGEP, including spatiotemporal models, environmental indices, factorial and spatiotemporal structure of plant breeding data, and cross-species prediction. A strategy is then proposed for prediction-based crop redesign at both the macro (individual, population, and species) and micro (gene, metabolism, and network) scales. Finally, we provide perspectives on translating smart breeding into genetic gain through integrative breeding platforms and open-source breeding initiatives. We call for coordinated efforts in smart breeding through iGEP, institutional partnerships, and innovative technological support.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The purpose of this research is to propose a novel framework called “MNet: Merged Net” for fast and accurate fruit classification, which addresses the misclassification problem overlooked by many researchers. To achieve this, a dataset consisting of 12,000 color images of top fruits in India with “Good” and “Bad” quality labels was created and published. The dataset consists of a total of 12 classes, and two models are created based on the popular pretrained model InceptionV3. The principal results of the study show that the proposed framework achieved 99.92\\\\% accuracy and moderated the image misclassification problem. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate that the MFC\\\\_InceptionV3 model outperforms the InceptionV3 and FC\\\\_InceptionV3 models in terms of accuracy and misclassification problem. The major conclusion of this study is that the proposed framework, MNet, is a promising approach for fast and accurate fruit classification, which improves the accuracy and addresses the misclassification problem.

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture plays a major role in developing countries like India, however the food security still remains a vital issue. Most of the crops get wasted due to lack of storage facility, transportation, and plant diseases. More than 15\\\\% of the crops get wasted in India due to diseases and hence it has become one of the major concern to be resolved. There is a need of automatic system that can identify these diseases and help farmers to take appropriate steps to get rid of crop loss. Farmers have followed the conventional method of identifying the plant disease with their naked eyes, and it not possible for all the farmers to identify these diseases the same way. With the advance in Artificial Intelligence, there is a need to incorporate the facilities of the computer vision in the field of agriculture. Deep Learning rich libraries and user as well as developer friendly environment to work with, all these qualities make Deep Learning as the favorable method to get started with this problem. In this paper we have used Deep Learning because of the advantages it offers to work with images especially in image classification to get improvised results. The methodology includes taking leaves of infected crops and label them as per the disease pattern. The images of infected leaves are processed pixel based operations are applied to improve the information from the image. As a next step feature extraction is done followed by image segmentation and at the last classification of crop diseases based on the patterns extracted from the diseased leaves. The CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is used for the classification of diseases, for the demonstration purpose the public dataset is used consisting of around 87 K images (RGB type images) including healthy as well as diseased leaves.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Traditional manual visual grading of fruits has been one of the important challenges faced by the agricultural industry due to its laborious nature as well as inconsistency in inspection and classification process. Automated defects detection using computer vision and machine learning has become a promising area of research with a high and direct impact on the domain of visual inspection. In this study, we propose an efficient and effective machine vision system based on the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and stacking ensemble methods to offer a non-destructive and cost-effective solution for automating the visual inspection of fruits’ freshness and appearance. We trained, tested and compared the performance of various deep learning models including ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNetV2, NASNet and EfficientNet to find the best model for the grading of fruits. The proposed system also provides a real time visual inspection using a low cost Raspberry Pi module with a camera and a touchscreen display for user interaction. The real time system efficiently segments multiple instances of the fruits from an image and then grades the individual objects (fruits) accurately. The system was trained and tested on two data sets (apples and bananas) and the average accuracy was found to be 99.2\\\\% and 98.6\\\\% using EfficientNet model for apples and bananas test sets, respectively. Additionally, a slight improvement in the recognition rate (0.03\\\\% for apples and 0.06\\\\% for bananas) was noted while applying the stacking ensemble deep learning methods. The performance of the developed system has been found higher than the existing methods applied to the same data sets previously. Further, during real-time testing on actual samples, the accuracy was found to be 96.7\\\\% for apples and 93.8\\\\% for bananas which indicates the efficacy of the developed system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Automatic detection of plant water status is a significant challenge in agriculture as it is a crucial regulator of growth, productivity, quality, and sustainability. As a result, accurate monitoring of the plant's water condition has become imperative. Internet of Things (IoT) solutions based on specific sensor data acquisition and intelligent processing can assist water users for precise irrigation by providing accurate, consistent, and fast results. This paper aims to present a hybrid deep learning approach based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for automatically identifying the water state of wheat. The intended scheme used IoT-based data transmission devices such as a digital camera, soil moisture, wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity. These environmental factors (EF) were recorded during the plant image capture. A total of 876 images of wheat plants were collected under different water deficit levels. A data augmentation approach was applied to expand the size of the training dataset to 5256 images. Various types of image color modes for example CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black), HSV (hue-saturation-value), RGB (red-greenblue), and grayscale were evaluated with our proposed methods. The experimental results indicated that the combined CNNRGB-LSTMEF-CNNEF deep network based on features from both RGB images, climatic conditions, and soil moisture performed better than features from individual RGB images. Its outputs of validation accuracy, classification precision, recall, F-measure, and intersection over union are 100\\\\% with a loss of 0.0012. The proposed system behavior is very encouraging to develop our methodology with other crops in the future. The designed framework can serve the agricultural community to detect the water stress of plants before the critical level of growth and make timely management decisions.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Milk weight records are an important source of information for daily decisions on dairy farms. Most milking parlor systems have technologies that record milk production at cow level on a daily basis. However, a great number of dairy farms simply do not have this crucial information because they lack the necessary technology in the parlor systems. The aim of this study is to implement a machine learning-based milk weighing scale exploring the dynamics of milking flow, looking for an alternative strategy for low-cost mechanical milking systems, and/or parlor milking systems without appropriated hardware/software integrated. We developed a milk flow sensor integrated to the milking parlor system to compute the milk flow during milking, and installed some cameras to label real milk weight. The regression model based on machine learning predicted the milk weight with high precision, achieving minimum values of 2.81, 1.29, and 10.26 in terms of mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), respectively, along with a maximum value of 0.84 in terms of the R2 index. We found that the area under milk flow curve (AUC), the number of milk flushes (MF), and the thirty-seventh to forty-fourth milk flow during milking have the most important influence in the efficacy of our proposed model. Milk flow of 250 cows milked 3 times a day were recorded during 12 days, generating 8,601 milk flow curves. Our preliminary results showed that we can confidently estimate the weight milk produced by a cow using machine learning algorithms to empower dairy farms to make better decisions.',\n",

Therefore, it is crucial to promptly and effectively treat early-stage WBPs by timely detection. The prompt detection of WBPs requires the use of advanced and effective methods, such as remote sensing. This paper provides an overview of the many uses of several remote sensing devices, platforms, and detection algorithms in the context of monitoring WBPs infestations. Modern lightweight sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), hyperspectral imagers, thermal cameras, and radio detection and ranging (Radar) combined with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with versatile capabilities offer a comprehensive and effective method for gathering data.

Identification of ripening is paramount importance to reduce loss. Bulk handlers and food processing industries requires automated non-destructive methods of ripening stage identification methodologies. This paper proposes a deep learning based non-destructive method of classification of banana fruit under four categories – unripe, under ripe, ripe and over ripe. A customized dataset was prepared with sufficient images in each class. A convolution neural network (CNN) combined with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost) algorithm (CNN-XgBoost) is introduced for the effective determination of the ripening stage of banana. CNN acts as the trainable feature extractor of the images and XgBoost acts as the identifier of ripening stage. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is incorporated in order to eliminate the need to have data augmentation or a huge data set. Thus, the proposed deep learning approach possesses capability to perform classification even with a smaller data set compared to conventional deep and machine learning techniques. The performance accuracy of the proposed duo is found to be 91.25 \\\\% and it is higher than that obtained with a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayesian Classifier (GNB) or k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithms.',\n",

Since all these activities deal with low or medium altitude images, automated identification of crop lines plays a crucial role improving these tasks. We address the problem of detecting and segmenting crop lines. We use a Convolutional Neural Network to segment the images, labeling their regions in crop lines or unplanted soil. We also evaluated three traditional semantic networks: U-Net, LinkNet, and PSPNet. We compared each network in four segmentation datasets provided by an expert. We also assessed whether the network’s output requires a post-processing step to improve the segmentation. Results demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of these networks in the proposed task.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Red Palm Weevil (RPW), also known as the palm weevil, is considered among the world’s most damaging insect pests of palms. Current detection techniques include the detection of symptoms of RPW using visual or sound inspection and chemical detection of volatile signatures generated by infested palm trees. However, efficient detection of RPW diseases at an early stage is considered one of the most challenging issues for cultivating date palms. In this paper, an efficient approach to the early detection of RPW is proposed. The proposed approach is based on RPW sound activities being recorded and analyzed. The first step involves the conversion of sound data into images based on a selected set of features. The second step involves the combination of images from the same sound file but computed by different features into a single image. The third step involves the application of different Deep Learning (DL) techniques to classify resulting images into two classes: infested and not infested. Experimental results show good performances of the proposed approach for RPW detection using different DL techniques, namely MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, ResNet152V2, VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, DenseNet201, Xception, and InceptionV3. The proposed approach outperformed existing techniques for public datasets.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The production of olives in Saudi Arabia, which accounts for around 6\\\\% of worldwide output, is regarded as one of the best in the world. Because olive trees are rain-fed and produced using conventional methods, yields vary greatly each year, which is made worse by viral illnesses and climate change. Therefore, it is necessary to identify plant illnesses early on. Farmers diagnose plant illnesses using conventional visual assessment or laboratory analysis. Diagnosing illnesses affecting olive leaves has been improved with deep learning (DL). To identify and categorize plant illnesses, this research introduces an Optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that analyses the plant's leaf. Data is first integrated for preprocessing, relevant features are extracted, and the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is used to select necessary features. Then the data is classified using ANN. The ANN classification approach utilizes the feed-forward neural network method (FFNN). ANN is a highly adaptable technology being utilized widely to address various problems. This study applies categorization to exclude possibilities throughout each stage, improving prediction accuracy. Compared to the current model employed for plant disease detection, the suggested model showed a considerable performance increase in Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-measure.\",\n",

Tagging of animals such as sheep and cows allows the farmer to have superior traceability, better breeding control, better conservation efforts, and of course, data collection about each and every animal of the herd.

However, currently, yield forecasts are mostly made close to harvest (e.g. 1–3 months before harvest for Chinese winter wheat), which gives stakeholders a relatively short time to react, decide, and intervene. To satisfy stakeholders' requirements for timely and precise yield forecasting, we propose a hybrid machine learning-enabled early-season yield forecasting method integrated with an intermediate climate forecast process. The results show that: (1) Compared with the baseline model, our proposed method advances winter wheat yield prediction up to 8 months before harvest with satisfactory accuracy. (2) The climate forecast process incorporated is effective and consistently optimized in various model combinations and controlled experiments. (3) The proposed method performs robustly over different spatial scales (e.g., in the first month of Chinese winter wheat, the yield predictive accuracy is improved in 183 out of 233 counties). In summary, our work provides an effective and robust approach for early-season yield forecasting that gives stakeholders more time to take appropriate actions to cope with crop yield volatility risks.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The real-time monitoring of wheat phenology variations among different varieties and their adaptive responses to environmental conditions is essential for advancing breeding efforts and improving cultivation management. Many remote sensing efforts have been made to relieve the challenges of key phenophase detection. However, existing solutions are not accurate enough to discriminate adjacent phenophases with subtle organ changes, and they are not real-time, such as the vegetation index curve-based methods relying on entire growth stage data after the experiment was finished. Furthermore, it is key to improving the efficiency, scalability, and availability of phenological studies. This study proposes a two-stage deep learning framework called PhenoNet for the accurate, efficient, and real-time classification of key wheat phenophases. PhenoNet comprises a lightweight encoder module (PhenoViT) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) module. The performance of PhenoNet was assessed using a well-labeled, multi-variety, and large-volume dataset (WheatPheno). The results show that PhenoNet achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.945, kappa coefficients (Kappa) of 0.928, and F1-score (F1) of 0.941. Additionally, the network parameters (Params), number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdds), and graphics processing unit memory required for classification (Memory) were 0.889 million (M), 0.093 Giga times (G), and 8.0 Megabytes (MB), respectively. PhenoNet outperformed eleven state-of-the-art deep learning networks, achieving an average improvement of 3.7\\\\% in OA, 5.1\\\\% in Kappa, and 4.1\\\\% in F1, while reducing average Params, MAdds, and Memory by 78.4\\\\%, 85.0\\\\%, and 75.1\\\\%, respectively. The feature visualization and ablation analysis explained that PhenoNet mainly benefited from using time-series information and lightweight modules. Furthermore, PhenoNet can be effectively transferred across years, achieving a high OA of 0.981 using a two-stage transfer learning strategy. Furthermore, an extensible web platform that integrates WheatPheno and PhenoNet and ensures that the work done in this study is accessible, interoperable, and reusable has been developed (https://phenonet.org/).',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Modern pig farming leaves much to be desired in terms of efficiency, as these systems rely mainly on electromechanical controls and can only categorize pigs according to their weight. This method is not only inefficient but also escalates labor expenses and heightens the threat of zoonotic diseases. Furthermore, confining pigs in large groups can exacerbate the spread of infections and complicate the monitoring and care of ill pigs. This research executed an experiment to construct a deep-learning sorting mechanism, leveraging a dataset infused with pivotal metrics and breeding imagery gathered over 24 months. This research integrated a Kalman filter-based algorithm to augment the precision of the dynamic sorting operation. This research experiment unveiled a pioneering machine vision sorting system powered by deep learning, adept at handling live imagery for multifaceted recognition objectives. The Individual recognition model based on Residual Neural Network (ResNet) monitors livestock weight for sustained data forecasting, whereas the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Nets (WGAN) image enhancement algorithm bolsters recognition in distinct settings, fortifying the model's resilience. Notably, system can pinpoint livestock exhibiting signs of potential illness via irregular body appearances and isolate them for safety. Experimental outcomes validate the superiority of this proposed system over traditional counterparts. It not only minimizes manual interventions and data upkeep expenses but also heightens the accuracy of livestock identification and optimizes data usage.

The huge adverse consequences and globally predicted climate change accentuate the importance of an effective drought assessment and management system. Lack of universality of available drought indices emphasize the need of an automated system that works globally. Internet of Things (IoT) is highly appropriated for ubiquitous monitoring, acquisition and evaluation of causing parameters for reliable prediction of drought situations. The framework includes dimensionality reduction algorithm at Fog layer through which only variance rich data passes. This data is evaluated at the Cloud layer to determine the drought severity level employing Artificial Neural Network (ANN), ANN optimized with Genetic Algorithm (ANN-GA), DNN (Deep Neural Network) and their performance is compared. Support Vector Regression (SVR) method predicts the drought conditions for three different climate blocks and three different time frames.

The free-of-cost sentinel 1 based SAR data along with machine learning models in GEE cloud was used for rainfed rice crop monitoring for 214 farm plots on a micro-scale in Hooghly, West Bengal, India. The individual plot rice parcel showed a low median backscattering signature for the SAR data during the land preparation/crop transplanting stages with VH and VV at −17.63 dB and −9.63 dB, respectively; whereas, higher median backscattering was experienced at the peak vegetation stage of VH and VV Polarization with −15.20 dB and −6.34 dB, respectively. The random forest model was found best suited with R2 of 0.87 for total crop biomass estimation. The backscatter values have a sound correlation with Heading NDVI, which validated the suitability of SAR images for crop monitoring under rainfed conditions. Further, crop yield prediction using SAR data and total biomass data through machine learning models showed positive correlation for Random forest, Extreme gradient boosting, and Decision tree models with an Area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) test accuracy of 0.99.

In this paper, we explore and compare different techniques for handling class imbalance in leaf disease detection to improve the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models in the context of precision agriculture.

       "  'abstract': 'Diseases and pests cause serious damage in crop production, reducing yield and fruit quality. Their identification is often time-consuming and requires trained personnel. New sensing technologies and artificial intelligence could be used for automatic identification of disease and pest symptoms on grapevine in precision viticulture. The aim of this work was to apply deep learning modelling and computer vision for the detection and differentiation of downy mildew and spider mite symptoms in grapevine leaves under field conditions. RGB images of grapevine canopy leaves with downy mildew symptoms, with spider mite symptoms and without symptoms were taken under field conditions in a commercial vineyard. The images were prepared using computer vision techniques to increase disease visual features. Finally, deep learning was used to train a model capable of differentiating leaf images of the three classes. An accuracy up to 0.94 (F1-score of 0.94) was obtained by classifying leaves with downy mildew, spider mite and without symptoms at the same time, using a hold-out validation. Additionally, accuracies between 0.89 and 0.91 (F1-scores between 0.89 and 0.91) were obtained in the binary classification of the disease and pest, obtaining the best results in differentiating downy mildew from spider mite symptoms. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning and computer vision techniques for the classification of grapevine leaf images taken under field conditions, automatically finding complex features capable of differentiating leaves with spider mite symptoms, with downy mildew symptoms and without any. These results prove the potential of these non-invasive techniques in the detection and differentiation of pests and diseases in commercial crop production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The rapid advances in Deep Learning (DL) techniques have enabled rapid detection, localisation, and recognition of objects from images or videos. DL techniques are now being used in many applications related to agriculture and farming. Automatic detection and classification of weeds can play an important role in weed management and so contribute to higher yields. Weed detection in crops from imagery is inherently a challenging problem because both weeds and crops have similar colours (‘green-on-green’), and their shapes and texture can be very similar at the growth phase. Also, a crop in one setting can be considered a weed in another. In addition to their detection, the recognition of specific weed species is essential so that targeted controlling mechanisms (e.g. appropriate herbicides and correct doses) can be applied. In this paper, we review existing deep learning-based weed detection and classification techniques. We cover the detailed literature on four main procedures, i.e., data acquisition, dataset preparation, DL techniques employed for detection, location and classification of weeds in crops, and evaluation metrics approaches. We found that most studies applied supervised learning techniques, they achieved high classification accuracy by fine-tuning pre-trained models on any plant dataset, and past experiments have already achieved high accuracy when a large amount of labelled data is available.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Data-driven models are efficient decision support tools for monitoring harmful algal blooms (HABs), particularly with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and continuous data acquisition sensing systems. While high chlorophyll-a concentrations in freshwater systems are often used as an index of HABs, diurnal variations in physicochemical water quality parameters influence chlorophyll-a concentrations in these systems. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models in predicting chlorophyll-a as an index of HABs. However, predicting HABs before they occur often comes with uncertainties related to the frequency of observed data. This study used varying sampling periods to develop various Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models coupled with a Monte Carlo dropout scheme to estimate model uncertainties for chlorophyll-a predictions in a freshwater lake. The model’s performances were compared using indices such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and correlation coefficient. The results showed that while a daily water quality dataset predicted chlorophyll-a concentrations 3-days in advance with the conventional 0.2 dropout rate, an hourly dataset predicted chlorophyll-a concentrations 7-days in advance. When the effect of the sampling period was considered, the full dataset (both daytime and nighttime datasets combined) provided better chlorophyll-a predictions compared to the model that only used either the daytime or nighttime dataset. This research outcome will assist in predicting HABs timely using chlorophyll-a as an index, aid in developing early warning systems, and understand the data-sampling, data-transmission, and data-storage needs, which are often the critical elements for data-driven modeling.',\n",

Nitrogen, an essential nutrient, is a crucial growth-limiting factor and is the prime component of amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. Nitrogen deficiency affects certain visible plant traits such as area, color, the number of leaves and plant height, etc. With the recent advancements in imaging technology, computer vision-based plant phenomics has become a promising field of plant research and management. Such imaging-based techniques are non-destructive and much faster with higher levels of automation. In this work, we have proposed an automatic image-based plant phenotyping approach for stress classification in plant shoot images. In this proposed phenotyping approach, a 23-layered deep learning technique is proposed and compared with traditional Machine Learning techniques and few other deep architectures. Results reveal that a simple 23-layered deep learning architecture is comparable to the established state of art deep learning architectures like ResNet18 and NasNet Large (having millions of trainable parameters) in yielding ceiling level stress classification from plant shoot images. In addition, the proposed model also outperforms traditional Machine Learning techniques by achieving an average of 8.25\\\\% better accuracy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Accurate and timely observations of wheat phenology and, particularly, of heading date are instrumental for many scientific and technical domains such as wheat ecophysiology, crop breeding, crop management or precision agriculture. Visual annotation of the heading date in situ is a labour-intensive task that may become prohibitive in scientific and technical activities where high-throughput is needed. This study presents an automatic method to estimate wheat heading date from a series of daily images acquired by a fixed RGB camera in the field. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to identify the presence of spikes in small patches. The heading date is then estimated from the dynamics of the spike presence in the patches over time. The method is applied and validated over a large set of 47 experimental sites located in different regions in France, covering three years with nine wheat cultivars. Results show that our method provides good estimates of the heading dates with a root mean square error close to 2 days when compared to the visual scoring from experts. It outperforms the predictions of a phenological model based on the ARCWHEAT crop model calibrated for our local conditions. The potentials and limits of the proposed methodology towards a possible operational implementation in agronomic applications and decision support systems are finally further discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent advancements in the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based remote sensing (RS) in precision agricultural practices have been critical in enhancing crop health and management. UAV-based RS and advanced computational algorithms including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), are progressively being applied to make predictions, solve decisions to optimize the production and operation processes in many farming industries such as sugarcane. UAVs with various advanced sensors, including RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, LIDAR, and thermal cameras, have been used for crop RS applications as they can provide new approaches and research opportunities in precision sugarcane production. This review focuses on the use of UAVs in the sugarcane industry for pest and disease management, yield estimation, phenotypic measurement, soil moisture assessment, and nutritional status evaluation to improve the productivity and environmental sustainability. The goals of this review were to: (1) assemble information on the application of UAVs in the sugarcane industry; and (2) discuss their benefits and limitations in a variety of applications in UAV-based sugarcane cultivation. A literature review was conducted utilizing three bibliographic databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and 179 research articles that are relevant to UAV applications in sugarcane and other general information about UAV and sensors collected from the databases mentioned earlier. The study concluded that UAV-based crop RS can be an effective method for sugarcane monitoring and management to improve yield and quality and significantly benefits on social, economic, and environmental aspects. However, UAV-based RS should also consider some of the challenges in sugar industries include technological adaptations, high initial cost, inclement weather, communication failures, policy, and regulations.',\n",

A digital twin is a promising tool to minimize fruit waste by monitoring and predicting the status of fresh produce throughout its life. In post-harvest engineering, the digital twin could be defined as a virtual representation of real produce. The objective of this work is to present a new approach to create a machine learning-based digital twin of banana fruit to monitor its quality changes throughout storage. The thermal camera has been used as a data acquisition tool due to its capability to detect the surface and physiological changes of fruits throughout the storage. In this study, after constructing the dataset of thermal data belonging to four classes, the training of the model has been performed using intelligent technologies from SAP. The solution has applied a deep convolutional neural network to monitor the fruit status based on the thermal information, and the training process has shown higher accuracy. Thus, 99\\\\% of prediction accuracy has been achieved which is proved to be a promising technique for the development of fruit digital twins. The application of thermal imaging techniques can be used as a data source to create a machine learning-based digital twin of fruit that can minimize waste in the food supply chain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Increased biosecurity and food safety requirements may increase demand for efficient traceability and identification systems of livestock in the supply chain. The advanced technologies of machine learning and computer vision have been applied in precision livestock management, including critical disease detection, vaccination, production management, tracking, and health monitoring. This paper offers a systematic literature review (SLR) of vision-based cattle identification. More specifically, this SLR is to identify and analyse the research related to cattle identification using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). This study retrieved 731 studies from four online scholarly databases. Fifty-five articles were subsequently selected and investigated in depth. For the two main applications of cattle detection and cattle identification, all the ML based papers only solve cattle identification problems. However, both detection and identification problems were studied in the DL based papers. Based on our survey report, the most used ML models for cattle identification were support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). Convolutional neural network (CNN), residual network (ResNet), Inception, You Only Look Once (YOLO), and Faster R-CNN were popular DL models in the selected papers. Among these papers, the most distinguishing features were the muzzle prints and coat patterns of cattle. Local binary pattern (LBP), speeded up robust features (SURF), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and Inception or CNN were identified as the most used feature extraction methods. This paper details important factors to consider when choosing a technique or method. We also identified major challenges in cattle identification. There are few publicly available datasets, and the quality of those datasets are affected by the wild environment and movement while collecting data. The processing time is a critical factor for a real-time cattle identification system. Finally, a recommendation is given that more publicly available benchmark datasets will improve research progress in the future.',\n",

Thus, in this paper, we collected images of Indonesian crops from the internet randomly and proposed a classification by using transfer learning of deep learning with four pre-trained models: EffficientNet- B0, ResNet18, VGG19, and AlexNet. In the experiment, augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flip, random vertical flip, and random affine were utilized to prevent the network from overfitting. The result found that EfficientNet-B0 outperformed other models with an accuracy of 82.55. Then, the model struggled to distinguish between crops in the same family.

The following paper investigates a variety of methods for predicting crop yields using a variety of soil and environmental variables. The main purpose of this project is to make a machine learning model make predictions. By taking into account several variables, machine learning algorithms can help farmers decide which crop to grow in addition to increasing yield.

Irregular or aperiodic variations of different WQ variables can influence the growth, survival, and yield of aquatic livestock in the ponds. In this research, WQ and harvest data collected from an Australian prawn farm over a whole grow-out season is used to investigate how the variations of WQ influence the harvest outcome of prawns from the ponds. We present a set of approaches based on machine learning to: (i) understand the effect of five WQ variables in differentiating high and low performing ponds (in terms for harvest performance); and (ii) identify how the variations in these WQ variables over the grow-out season contributed to final harvest outcome (growth and yield). To develop the ponds classification approach, we apply eight different machine learning classifiers: neural networks, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, gaussian naïve bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost. To identify the driving factors (in terms of variations of WQ) that affect growth and yield of aquatic livestock in ponds, we apply three feature selection methods: mutual information, correlation-based feature selection, and ReliefF. Results demonstrate that dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature are the three WQ variables that have the greatest influence on overall harvest performance of the ponds. Changes in dissolved oxygen and salinity in the last quarter of the grow-out season, and variations of temperature immediately after stocking contributed the most to differentiate the high and low performing ponds.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The red palm weevil (RPW) is one of the most popular and damaging pests which threaten palm cultivation and production in many countries in the world. Recognizing RPW pests is not an easy task as it is difficult to detect the RPW insect in the early stages of infestation, because there are not many visible external signs on the palm trees, and once the tree is infested it is too late to save it. In response to this urgent problem, a proposed transfer learning methodology is developed to recognize RPW pests using the VGGish deep learning model based on the acoustic signal features of RPW pests sounds. The proposed model has been trained and validated using RPW sound samples taken from RPW public benchmarked dataset. The RPW dataset consists of 2485 audio samples divided into 1754 healthy samples and 731 infested samples. The validation results clarified the efficiency of the proposed transfer learning model in recognizing RPW pest' sounds based on the amplitude and phase features of the acoustic signals. The performance evaluation metrics showed promising results in detecting the RPW pest's sounds, where it achieved an accuracy of 94.5\\\\%, precision of 93\\\\%, recall of 95\\\\%, and F1-score of 94\\\\%. To validate the efficiency of the proposed VGGish model, four practical comparisons with four machine learning models (i.e. Support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), Gaussian naïve Bayes (NB), and Logistic regression (LR)) and five practical comparisons with five deep learning models (i.e. InceptionResV3, ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, and Xception) are conducted using the same dataset. The comparison results confirmed the superiority of the VGGish model in recognizing RPW pest's sounds compared to the four and five machine and deep learning models respectively.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Deforestation is depletion of the forest cover and degradation in forest quality mainly through repeated fires, over-exploitation, and diseases. In a forest ecosystem, occurrence of wildfires is a natural phenomena. The curse of global warming and man-made interventions have made the wildfires increasingly extreme and widespread. Though, extremely challenging due to rapidly changing climate, accurate prediction of these fire events can significantly improve forestation worldwide. In this paper, we have addressed this issue by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework using long short term memory (LSTM) model. The proposed mechanism accurately forecasts weekly fire alerts and associated burnt area (ha) utilizing historical fire data provided by GLOBAL FOREST WATCH. Pakistan is taken as a case study since its deforestation rate is among the highest in the world while having one of the lowest forest covers. Number of epochs, dense layers, hidden layers and hidden layer units are varied to optimize the model for high estimation accuracy and low root mean square error (RMSE). Simulation results show that the proposed method can predict the forest fire occurrences with 95\\\\% accuracy by employing a suitable hyperparameter tuning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper presents the development of an autonomous harvesting robot system for tomato, a representative crop cultivated in the facility horticulture smart farm. The automated harvesting work using a robotic system is very challenging because of the appearance, environmental features, such as the atypical directions of the peduncles or their growing form in a bunch. Also, the robot system should enable the harvesting of the target fruit only without damaging other fruits, stems, and branches. Hence, this paper presents a deep learning network pipeline, Deep-ToMaToS, capable of three-level maturity classification and 6D pose (3D translation + 3D rotation) estimation of the target fruit simultaneously. Due to the difficulties encountered in building a large-scale dataset to train and test the deep learning model for the 6D pose estimation in the real world, we presented an automatic data collection scheme based on a photo-realistic 3D simulator environment. The robotic harvesting system includes a harvesting motion control algorithm based on the result of the 6D pose estimation. The overall process of the motion control phase is described along with the decision way of the appropriate final posture of the harvesting module mounted at the end-effector of the robot manipulator via removal of invalid motions getting out of the valid workspace or redundant motions. We conducted experiments on the 6D pose estimation based on the Deep-ToMaToS and the harvesting motion control in virtual and real smart farm environments. The experimental results showed a 6D pose estimation accuracy of 96 \\\\% based on the ADD\\\\_S metric, and the proposed harvesting motion control algorithm achieves the harvesting success rate of 84.5 \\\\% on average. The experimental results reveal that the harvesting robot system has significant potential to extend to harvesting works for other fruits and crops.',\n",

To solve this problem, a novel approach to optimize physical parameters of octagonal tank using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning (ML) is proposed. The initial tank is regarded as the benchmark, six vital parameters of octagonal tank including inlet and outlet diameters, fillet radius, inlet height, inlet angle and inlet velocity have been numerically investigated by CFD. Modelling development and optimization based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm ΙΙ (NSGA-Ⅱ) are developed to obtain the Pareto front for maximizing effective energy utilization rate and minimizing the vortex STD. Some key findings are found that: 1) The model provides high predictive capability: RMSE of average velocity is 0.002.2) NSGA-Ⅱ combining ANN is applied in the optimization process to obtain 78 groups of optimal Pareto front.3) A series of optimal parameters are achieved by LINMAP, the optimal parameter combination could improve the energy utilization rate up to 12.32 corresponding with the benchmark. 4) Inlet velocity of 0.1 m/s and inlet diameter of 103.9 mm in the culture tank can be more significant for improving flow uniformity but also raising effective energy utilization rate.

       "  'abstract': 'A significant threat to agriculture yield is crop disease. It leads to enormous losses for farmers and also has an impact economically. Leaves affected by certain diseases will exhibit unique characteristics, which will be utilized by deep learning frameworks to identify the diseases. In this paper, the Complete Concatenated Deep Learning (CCDL) architecture, a multi-crop disease detection model is proposed that is capable to classify the crop diseases irrespective of crops. In this architecture, Complete Concatenated Block (CCB) is introduced as a core functional unit. In this unit, the point convolution layer is positioned before every convolution layer to confine the number of parameters generated in the model. A complete concatenation path is invoked upon the convolution layers, contained within the CCB. It enhances the utilization of feature maps and helps to achieve better classification accuracy. The proposed architecture is trained using the reorganized Plant Village dataset. Later the trained model has been pruned for model size reduction, called Pruned Complete Concatenated Deep Learning model (PCCDL).

       "  'abstract': \"The increasing gap between the demand and productivity of maize crop is a point of concern for the food industry, and farmers. Its' susceptibility to diseases such as Turcicum Leaf Blight, and Rust is a major cause for reducing its production. Manual detection, and classification of these diseases, calculation of disease severity, and crop loss estimation is a time-consuming task. Also, it requires expertise in disease detection. Thus, there is a need to find an alternative for automatic disease detection, severity prediction, and crop loss estimation. The promising results of machine learning, and deep learning algorithms in pattern recognition, object detection, and data analysis motivate researchers to employ these techniques for disease detection, classification, and crop loss estimation in maize crop. The research works available in literature, have proven their potential in automatic disease detection using machine learning, and deep learning models. But, there is a lack none of these works a reliable and real-life labelled dataset for training these models. Also, none of the existing works focus on severity prediction, and crop loss estimation. The authors in this manuscript collect the real-life dataset labelled by plant pathologists. They propose a deep learning-based framework for pre-processing of dataset, automatic disease detection, severity prediction, and crop loss estimation. It uses the K-Means clustering algorithm for extracting the region of interest. Next, they employ the customized deep learning model ‘MaizeNet’ for disease detection, severity prediction, and crop loss estimation. The model reports the highest accuracy of 98.50\\\\%. Also, the authors perform the feature visualization using the Grad-CAM. Now, the proposed model is integrated with a web application to provide a user-friendly interface. The efficacy of the model in extracting the relevant features, a smaller number of parameters, low training time, high accuracy favors its importance as an assisting tool for plant pathology experts.The copyright for the associated web application ‘Maize-Disease-Detector’ is filed with diary number: 17006/2021-CO/SW.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Ethiopia is the largest producer of chickpeas in Africa. Crop production and yield in Ethiopia is greatly affected by plant diseases which cause loss of agricultural products every year. One of these plant diseases is chickpea disease which is a fungal disease. Ascochyta blight and Fusarium wilt are the most common chickpea diseases in Ethiopia that affect crop production quality and quantity. The identification of these diseases requires experienced experts or systems. Although numerous methods have been previously adopted in literature, deep learning (DL) is suggested as an efficient approach for disease recognition and classification since it can automatically learn features from the input image. In this paper, a chickpea disease detection model was developed using deep learning techniques by combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for feature extraction and Softmax for classification. To develop the proposed model, various image preprocessing stages such as image resizing, normalization, and noise filtering using a combination of Gaussian filter (GF) and Median filter (MF) were performed. To prevent the problem of overfitting, augmentation was applied, while to train and test the effectiveness of the developed model, 8391 images were used. From the acquired images, 80\\\\% of the dataset was used for training, 20\\\\% of the dataset was used for testing and out of the 80\\\\% training data, 20\\\\% was used for validation. The proposed CNN-LSTM performed well in identifying chickpea disease, with an accuracy of 92.55\\\\%. According to the study's findings, the proposed CNN-LSTM outperforms existing methods.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The recent technological advances and their applications to agriculture provide leverage for the new paradigm of smart agriculture. Remote sensing applications can help optimise resources, making agriculture more ecological, increasing productivity and helping farmers to anticipate events that could not otherwise be avoided. Considering that losses caused by anomalies such as diseases, weeds and pests account for 20–40 \\\\% of overall agricultural productivity, a successful research effort in this area would be a breakthrough for agriculture. In this paper, we propose a methodology with which to discover and classify anomalies in images of crops, taken from a wide range of distances, using different Convolutional Neural Network architectures. This methodology also deals with several difficulties that usually appear in this kind of problems, such as class imbalance, the insufficient and small variety of images, overtraining or lack of models generalisation. We have implemented four convolutional neural network architectures in a high-performance computing environment, and propose a methodology based on data augmentation with the addition of Gaussian noise to the images to solve the above problems. Our approach was tested using two well-established open datasets that are unalike: DeepWeeds, which provides a classification of 8 weed species native to Australia using images that were taken at a distance of 1 m, and Agriculture-Vision, which classifies 6 types of crop anomalies using multispectral satellite imagery. Our methodology attained accuracies of 98 \\\\% and 95.3\\\\% respectively, improving the state-of-the-art by several points. In order to ease reproducibility and model selection, we have provided a comparison in terms of computational time and other metrics, thus enabling the choice between architectures to be made according to the resources available. The complete code is available in an open repository in order to encourage reproducibility and promote scientific advances in sustainable agriculture.',\n",

In this paper, an improved monitoring and data-driven modelling of the dynamics of parameters affecting the irrigation of mustard leaf plant is presented. An IoT-based monitoring framework is implemented using ESPresso Lite V2.0 module interfaced with different soil moisture sensors (VH-400), flowmeter (YF-S201) as well as Davis vantage pro 2 weather station to measure soil moisture content, irrigation volume, and computation of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The data collected including plant images were transmitted to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for onward online storage and the data are displayed on the IoT dashboard. The combination of both soil moisture and ETo values was used for scheduling a drip irrigated plant grown in a greenhouse for 35 days. A total number of 20, 703 experimental data samples are collected from the IoT-based platform was further used for data driven modelling through system identification in MATLAB. The result shows the development of different predictive models for soil moisture content prediction. The ARX prediction model is found to perform better than the ARMX, BJ and State space model in terms of estimated fit of 91.31\\\\%, 91.09\\\\%, 91.08\\\\%, and 90.75\\\\% respectively.

       "  'abstract': \"Weather forecasting is essential in various applications such as olive smart farming. Farmers use the predicted weather data to take appropriate actions with the aim of increasing the crop production. Many deep learning models have been developed for tackling such a problem. However, olive groves are located in remote areas with no Internet connectivity, therefore these models are not applicable as they require either powerful processors or communication with cloud servers for inference. In this work, we propose a deep learning encoder-decoder model that uses a seasonal attention mechanism for time series forecasting of weather variables. The proposed model is non-complex, yet more powerful, compared to the more complex models in the literature. We use this model as the core of a framework that preprocess the training and testing data, train the model, and deploy the model on a resource-constrained microcontroller. Using real-life weather datasets of Spanish, Greek, and Chinese weather stations, we prove that the proposed model achieves a higher prediction accuracy compared to the existing literature. More specifically, the achieved prediction mean absolute error (MAE) is 2.13 °C and root mean squared error (RMSE) is 2.64 °C. This outstanding accuracy performance is achieved with the model requiring only 37.6 kB of memory for storing the model parameters with a total memory requirement of 50.1 kB. Since the model is relatively non-complex, we implement it on the Raspberry Pi Pico platform which has a very low cost with minimal power consumption compared to other embedded platforms. We also build a prototype and test it to verify the model's ability to achieve the target objective in real-life scenarios.\",\n",

Lodging is a primary threat to rice production, decreasing rice yield, and quality. Lodging assessment is a tedious task and requires heavy labor and a long duration due to the vast land areas involved. Newly developed autonomous crop scouting techniques have shown promise in mapping crop fields without any human interaction. By combining autonomous scouting and lodged rice detection with edge computing, it is possible to estimate rice lodging faster and at a much lower cost than previous methods. This study presents an adaptive crop scouting mechanism for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).

       "  'abstract': 'Special behavior detection of fish is an effective way to ensure fish welfare and improve the intelligent level of aquaculture. However, due to the influence of the breeding environment and physiological factors, fish are prone to cannibalism during the juvenile period. In order to effectively monitor the behavior of the fry, this article proposes a real-time detection scheme based on the improved You Only Look Once (YOLO)-v5 to detect the cannibalism of grouper fry in recirculating aquaculture system(RAS). The specific improvements are as follows: (1) Multi-head attention mechanism is used to obtain global information in the last block of the backbone network (2) According to the idea of BIfpn, nodes that contribute little in the feature network which combines different features the neck is deleted. At the same time, feature fusion is added for nodes whose input and output are in the same layer (3) The lightweight general upsampling operator Carafe is used to replace the original upsampling. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5 model achieves 97\\\\% accuracy in the detection of cannibalism behavior of juvenile fish, effectively solving the problems of small targets, severe occlusion and motion blur in the culture environment. Meanwhile, compared with the YOLOv5s model, the improved model has 12.6\\\\% and 14\\\\% improvement in detection accuracy and processing speed, respectively, and achieves the requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection. In the actual aquaculture environment, farmers can take corresponding measures according to the detection results, which can effectively improve the survival rate and economic benefits of aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Timely and accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is essential for precise irrigation management at the farm scale. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing with a high spatiotemporal resolution has become a promising method for SMC monitoring. Many existing SMC models have only been tested at a specific crop growth stage using a single type of sensor, and the effects of growth stage and irrigation variation on SMC estimation accuracy remain unclear. To address these limitations, this study used UAV-based multimodal data to quantify SMC in a maize field under various levels of irrigation over two years using three machine learning algorithms (MLA): partial least squares regression (PLSR), K nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest regression (RFR). The results demonstrated that multimodal data fusion improves the SMC estimation accuracy regardless of the MLA, especially the joint use of thermal and multispectral data. Among three SMC regression models, the RFR model produced the most accurate SMC estimation for the two growing seasons regardless of sensor combinations. The RFR model using all three types of data generated the most accurate and robust SMC estimation at the vegetative stage with R2 of 0.68 and 0.78, and rRMSE of 20.82\\\\% and 19.36\\\\% for 10- and 20-cm soil depths, respectively; it also produced the best SMC estimation accuracy under well-watered and mild to modest deficit irrigation treatments for both soil depths. The study shows that the high spatial–temporal maps of SMC using UAV-based multimodal data has promising potential for supporting decision-making in irrigation scheduling at the farmland scale.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Apple picking robot is now being developed as an alternative to hand picking due to a great demand for labor during apple harvest season. Accurate detection and localization of target fruit is necessary for robotic apple picking. Detection accuracy has a great influence on localization results. Although current researches on detection and localization of apples using traditional image algorithms can obtain good results under laboratory conditions, it is difficult to accurately detect and locate objects in natural field with complex environments. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, accuracy of apple detection based on deep learning has been significantly improved. Therefore, a deep learning-based method was developed to accurately detect and locate the position of fruit. For different localization methods, binocular localization is a widely used localization method for its bionic principle and lower equipment cost. Hence, this paper proposed an improved binocular localization method for apple based on fruit detection using deep learning. First, apples of binocular images were detected by Faster R-CNN. After that, a segmentation based on chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration ratio was applied to segment apple and background pixels in bounding box of detected fruit. Furthermore, template matching with parallel polar line constraint was used to match apples in left and right images. Finally, two feature points on apples were selected to directly calculate three dimensional coordinates of feature points with the binocular localization principle. In this study, Faster R-CNN achieved an AP of 88.12\\\\% with an average detection speed of 0.32 s for an image. Meanwhile, standard deviation and localization precision of depth of two feature points on each apple were calculated to evaluate localization. Results showed that the average standard deviation and the average localization precision of 76 groups of datasets were 0.51 cm and 99.64\\\\%, respectively. Results indicated that the proposed improved binocular localization method is promising for fruit localization.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Estimating three-dimensional (3D) fruit-level phenotypic traits of apple trees can potentially improve apple orchard breeders' management strategy. However, the phenotypic traits of apple fruits (including the quantity, 3D distribution, and volume of apples) constitute important parameters that influence yield but are difficult to quantify manually. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively and efficiently quantify apple phenotyping to monitor apple yield and support a better management system. This study developed a novel method for extracting individual 3D apple traits and 3D mapping for three apple training systems. The 3D point cloud of apples was reconstructed from multi-view images collected via a multi-camera system-based unmanned-aerial vehicle. Individual apples in the 3D point cloud were extracted via a 3D instance segmentation algorithm that included generalized sparse convolutional neural networks, a weighted discriminative loss function, and a varying density-based 3D clustering method. The developed apple trait extraction algorithm can help compute the position and volume of an individual apple. The R2 values with the average weighted-mean-absolute-percentage error (WMAPE) of apple counting and apple volume estimation were 0.84–0.99 (VMAPE = 3.41–12.75\\\\%) and 0.84–0.90 (WMAPE = 4.74–7.03\\\\%), respectively. The 3D spatial and volumetric distribution of apples were obtained and analyzed. This study developed an effective method combining 3D photography and 3D instance segmentation that can accurately estimate individual apple phenotypic traits from different types of apple training systems in orchards and can also be utilized for the analysis of other fruit traits.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the recent trends in urban agriculture and climate change, there is an emerging need for alternative plant culture techniques where dependence on soil can be eliminated. Hydroponic and aquaponic growth techniques have proven to be viable alternatives, but the lack of efficient and optimal practices for irrigation and nutrient supply limits its applications on a large-scale commercial basis. The main purpose of this research was to develop statistical methods and Machine Learning algorithms to regulate nutrient concentrations in aquaponic irrigation water based on plant needs, for achieving optimal plant growth and promoting broader adoption of aquaponic culture on a commercial scale. One of the key challenges to developing these algorithms is the sparsity of data which requires the use of Bolstered error estimation approaches. In this paper, several linear and non-linear algorithms trained on relatively small datasets using Bolstered error estimation techniques were evaluated, for selecting the best method in making decisions regarding the regulation of nutrients in hydroponic environments. After repeated tests on the dataset, it was decided that Semi-Bolstered Resubstitution Error estimation technique works best in our case using Linear Support Vector Machine as the classifier with the value of penalty parameter set to one. A set of recommended rules have been prescribed as a Decision Support System, using the output of the Machine Learning algorithm, which have been tested against the results of the baseline model. Further, the positive impact of the recommended nutrient concentrationson plant growth in aquaponic environments has been elaborately discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the upcoming irrigation management in agricultural production, accurate mapping of crop water consumption with a high spatial and temporal resolution at a farm scale is needed. In this study, we developed models for crop coefficients (Kc) estimation using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing and machine learning (ML) techniques for irrigated maize in a semi-arid region in Northwest China. Kc values were calculated using a procedure given in FAO56 manual using field measurements. Multispectral vegetation indices (VIs), vegetation fraction (VF), thermal-based VIs, and texture information (TI) were derived from UAV-based multispectral, RGB, and thermal infrared imagery, respectively. These remotely sensed variables and their combinations were used to develop prediction models using six ML algorithms (linear regression-LR, polynomial regression-PR, exponential regression-ER, random forest regression-RFR, support vector regression-SVR, and deep neural network-DNN). Among these models, the RFR with the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.1019) was recommended to estimate maize Kc. The multispectral and thermal-based VIs and texture of the near-infrared band had greater contributions than RGB-based VF and TI in the Kc-RFR model under different irrigation treatments. Furthermore, the maize Kc-RFR prediction model had high accuracy in estimating cumulative evapotranspiration (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 15.0 mm/stage) during different growth stages and daily soil water content (R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.0089 m3/m3) in the root zone. These results show that the integration of UAV remote sensing and ML provides a promising tool to help farmers make decisions using timely mapped crop water consumption, especially under water shortages or drought conditions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Fruit usually plays a vital role in people's daily life. Many kinds of fruits are rich in vitamins and trace elements, which have high edible value. Pests and diseases are a considerable problem in the process of fruit planting. The quality and quantity of fruit can be effectively improved by the detection and preventing pests and diseases. However, suppose in the process of fruit growth, it is always necessary to manually identify and detect pests and diseases. In that case, it will inevitably consume a lot of workforce and material resources. Therefore, it is advisable to have an automated system to save unnecessary time and effort. This article introduces the detection and identification system of pests and diseases based on Raspberry Pi to identify and detect the pests and diseases of fruit such as Longan and lychee. Firstly, we constructed a knowledge graph of pests and diseases related to lychee and longan. Then, we used the Raspberry Pi to control the camera to capture the pests and diseases images. Next, the system processed and recognized the images captured by the camera. Finally, the Bluetooth speaker broadcasted the results in real-time. We constructed the knowledge graph through data collection, information extraction, knowledge fusion and storage. We trained the vgg-16 model, which achieves 94.9\\\\% accuracy in the pests identification task, and we deployed it on a Raspberry Pi.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The crop pests and diseases in agriculture is one of the most important reason for the reduction of bulk grain and oil crops and the decline of fruit and vegetable crop quality, which threaten macroeconomic stability and sustainable development. However, the recognition method based on manual and instruments has been unable to meet the needs of scientific research and production due to its strong subjectivity and low efficiency. The recognition method based on pattern recognition and deep learning can automatically fit image features, and use features to classify and predict images. This study introduced the improved Vision Transformer (ViT) method for crop pest image recognition. Among them, the region with the most obvious features can be effectively selected by block partition. The self-attention mechanism of the transformer can better excavate the special solution that is not an obvious lesion area. In the experiment, data with 7 classes of examples are used for verification. It can be illustrated from results that this method has high accuracy and can give full play to the advantages of image processing and recognition technology, accurately judge the crop diseases and pests category, provide method reference for agricultural diseases and pests identification research, and further optimize the crop diseases and pests control work for agricultural workers in need.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) is crucial and influential in irrigation water management. Precise ETo rate estimation is vital for successful agriculture water management. There are numerous techniques for ETo rate simulation, but machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches are currently popular. This study proposes an ensemble learning-based model for ETo rate estimation. The proposed model leverages minimum meteorological parameters, i.e., minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), relative humidity (RH), and mean wind speed (WS) as input features. The proposed model employs Random Forest Bagging and Gradient Boosting models as bagging and boosting ensemble techniques for the accurate ETo rate estimation. The 10-fold cross-validation method is leveraged for the evaluation of the proposed model. The performance results of the proposed model are compared with the baseline model of ETo estimation, i.e., the Food and Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) and off-the-shelf deep learning models. The performance results indicate that Random Forest Bagging is significant as it yields Gradient Boosting and baseline models with 93.15\\\\% f-measure and reduces Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 17\\\\% and 10\\\\%, respectively.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Although multi-spectral technology has been widely used to develop low-cost and low-power fruit internal quality detector, the detection precision was poor because of few wavelengths used. To improve the detection precision, we proposed a novel generation method on fruit’s false spectra with hundreds of wavelengths (named false full-spectra) from obtained multi-spectra with 12 wavelengths for kiwifruit and 11 wavelengths for pear using deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN), and the method was evaluated by traditional partial least squares regression (PLSR) and one dimensional convolutional neural network models (1D-CNN). The results showed that the generated false full-spectra obtained by DCGAN had high similarity with the ‘real’ full-spectra no matter for kiwifruit and pear. The mean structural similarity between the false full-spectra and the ‘real’ full-spectra of prediction set of kiwifruit and pear was 0.9490 and 0.9877, respectively, and their mean peak signal-to-noise ratio was 35.82 dB and 44.59 dB, respectively. The prediction performances of the built PLSR and 1D-CNN models based on false full-spectra for internal qualities (soluble solids content and firmness) of kiwifruit and pear were much better than those based on multi-spectra and were very close to those based on ‘real’ full-spectra. This study provides a novel idea to improve the detection performance of the multi-spectra-based detector without increasing the hardware cost.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are revolutionizing the globe with their sensing technologies. This initiative aims to design and deploy a cattle health monitoring system (CHMS) for the agriculture sector for the well-being of livestock and the eradication of hunger. The production and consumption of all dairy and meat products can only be conducted responsibly if the health of the source animal is protected. In this regard, WSNs, a component of the Internet-of-things (IoT) system, can be utilized for monitoring cow health due to their adaptability and portability, which enables them to be applied to expansive domains such as cattle healthcare. The integration of IoT and artificial intelligence enables the prediction of livestock illnesses. The primary purpose of this proposed system is to forecast cattle diseases utilizing real-time data from non-invasive body-area sensors and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and to display the expected results to authorized personnel via a web application. Popular authentication schemes are used in this system as it is susceptible to hacking and requires robust network security to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its resources. The presented results validates the accuracy of the proposed novel system for cow diseases prediction that is approximately 98 percent. The proposed CHMS can assist concerned farmers in remotely monitoring the health of their livestock from a variety of locations and in taking appropriate and timely measures to protect animal health. Technological automation will lower prices and labor inputs while enhancing farm output.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Soil moisture (SM) exerts a significant impact on crop growth, interacting with environmental factors such as temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and CO2, ultimately affecting crop photosynthesis (Pn). This study employs a nested experimental design to investigate the photosynthetic activity of cucumber seedlings under diverse environmental conditions and establishes a support vector regression (SVR) model for Pn prediction. The SVR model takes temperature, PPFD, SM, and CO2 concentration as inputs and demonstrates a high level of accuracy (The model’s coefficient of determination = 0.9830, root mean square error = 0.9138). Subsequently, through a generalized additive model, the study unveils the significant impact of interactions between SM and PPFD on Pn. Accordingly, this research constructs a Pn response surface based on these two factors and identifies the maximum point of Gaussian curvature on this surface. Polynomial regression is applied to these points, yielding a comprehensive regulation strategy for SM and PPFD. In comparison to traditional methods based on maximizing Pn, this innovative approach reduces Pn by 12.9 \\\\% while significantly conserving light (35.59 \\\\%) and water (32.80 \\\\%) consumption. Although no significant changes are observed in crop physiological traits (plant height, stem diameter, dry weight, fresh weight), substantial variations are noted in irrigation volume and PPFD consumption. Thus, the regulation strategy proposed in this study embodies efficiency and energy conservation in greenhouse crop cultivation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Flower thinning at the most appropriate stage could achieve high and stable yield of apple. Achieving the accurate and real-time detection of apple flowers can provide necessary technical support for the vision system of thinning robots. An apple flower detection method based on lightweight YOLOv5s algorithm was proposed. The original Backbone of YOLOv5s was replaced by ShuffleNetv2, and the Conv module of the Neck part of YOLOv5s network was replaced by Ghost module. ShuffleNetv2 reduced the memory access cost through Channel Split operation. Ghost module reduced the computing cost of the general volume layer while maintaining the similar detection performance. The combination of these two methods in the improvement of YOLOv5s network can greatly reduce the size of the model and improve the detection speed, which was convenient for the migration and application of the model. To verify the effectiveness of the model, 3005 apple flower images in different environments were used for training and testing. The Precision, Recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv5s-ShuffleNetv2-Ghost model were 88.40 \\\\%, 86.10 \\\\%, and 91.80 \\\\%, respectively, the model size was only 0.61 MB, and the detection speed was 86.21 fps.

The results showed that the method was feasible for real-time and accurate detection of apple flowers.

       "  'abstract': 'In the age of climate change, even the farmers who possess indigenous knowledge face difficulties in making judicious decisions on crop health monitoring that leads to the failure of the crop which in turn results in the decline of crop production. Another reason for the decline in crop production can be the selection of unsuitable crops for cultivation and the inability of identifying the visible effect of the disease in a plant. The research paper deals with how the IoT technology helps in collecting information about conditions like temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall by applying various machine learning algorithms to obtain the output. The research work deals with Decision Tree to predict the crop condition and suggests a suitable solution, it also suggests which crop can be grown. Using a public dataset of 87,000 RGB images of diseased and healthy plant leaves, we train a convolutional neural network to identify diseases that are categorized into 38 different classes. This paper consists of a proposed model that takes real-time data for predicting the kind of crop which is the most suitable and will monitor the crop conditions in the field through weather analysis and crop disease diagnosis on a massive scale for better production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The wheat mite always causes major damage in wheat plants and results in significant yield losses. Therefore, detecting wheat mites can provide important information, such as pest population dynamics and integrated pest management by monitoring wheat mite populations. However, the automatic classification and counting of wheat mites from images taken from crop fields are more difficult than those obtained under laboratory conditions, due to complicated background in crop fields, light instability and small wheat mites in images. Furthermore, the manual identification of wheat mites is very time-consuming and complex. Deep learning technique provides an efficiently automated way for address the issue. This paper proposes a three-step deep learning method to identify and count wheat mites from digital images. First, original large images are separated into smaller images as datasets. Then, the small images are labeled and then enlarged so that each of them can be located in corresponding position of original image. Second, one CNN takes an image (of any size) as input and outputs a set of feature maps for the image. Afterwards, the extracted feature maps are input to Region Proposal Network (RPN), which may be most likely the areas of wheat mites and output a set of rectangular objective proposals, each with an object score. Then one 256-d vector is generated from the obtained proposals by the other CNN. The vector is input into two fully connected layers, a box-regression layer and a box-classification layer, which output the probability scores of the position information and the population of wheat mites, respectively. Moreover, the superposition of the results for the small images is taken as the number of wheat mites for each original image. By using different backbone deep learning networks, ZFnet with five layers and VGG16 with sixteen layers achieved the accuracies of 94.6\\\\% and 96.4\\\\%, respectively.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Accurately and objectively analyzing fish feeding intensity is essential to guiding feeding and production techniques. Fish feeding intensity in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) can be used to indicate a fish\\'s appetite. However, the low efficiency and lack of objectivity of manual observation are problems with current fish feeding intensity assessment processes. Applying acoustic techniques to aquaculture issues is an insufficiently explored area that requires new investigations, particularly into methods that explore temporal information in acoustic spectrograms. With Oplegnathus punctatus as the experimental species, we proposed a fish feeding intensity detection method based on the Mel Spectrogram and MobileNetV3-SBSC lightweight networks. First, the Oplegnathus punctatus feeding sound dataset, which has a total of 3 types—\"strong,\" \"medium,\" and \"none,\" was built. Next, Mel Spectrogram feature maps were extracted using steps including preprocessing, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Mel filter bank (MFB), etc. Finally, the MobileNetV3-SBSC lightweight network was used to detect and recognize the obtained feature maps. Experimental results indicated that the proposed MobileNetV3-SBSC model, as compared to the MobileNetV3-S model, improved test accuracy by 4.6\\\\% and decreased test loss by 67.4\\\\% with only a 0.84\\\\% increase in the number of parameters and a 3.08\\\\% increase in the model size. Additionally, we have verified that the accuracy of the test set was 59.6\\\\%, 53.3\\\\%, 83.3\\\\%, 85.3\\\\%, and 85.9\\\\% for groups of 5, 15, 40, 70, and 100 fish, respectively. This study demonstrated that the proposed method is not applicable to a small number of fish, which means that when the numbers of fish are small, changes in the feeding of individual fish would have a significant effect on the whole feeding feature map, leading to negligible changes in feeding features. However, in view of the commonly high aquaculture density, the proposed method can be used to automatically and objectively examine fish feeding, which could provide a theoretical basis and methodological support for further feeding decisions.',\n",

Therefore, based on the previously developed database architecture design for a smart poultry farm with multisensor data and retrospect of the already existing Aihen platform, the module for egg production forecasting was developed. Early development raised a set of challenges, i.e., partly inconsistent and imperfect data, insufficient overall amount of historical data.

       "  'abstract': 'Crop water stress is an inevitable and increasing challenge for agriculture. To improve crop water use efficiency, management of water stress and accurate estimation of crop traits were required. Among crop traits used to detect crop growth status and predict yield, fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is of great significance. We conducted studies in a maize field located in Inner Mongolia, China with different irrigation levels during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. UAV RGB imagery was captured to investigate the effect of image sensors on thresholds obtained by the fixed-threshold method (proposed in our recent study), and to provide reference FVC (FVCUAV\\\\_R) for FVC models based on UAV multispectral imagery. Five vegetation indices (VIs), calculated from UAV multispectral imagery, and three regression algorithms (RF: random forest, ANN: artificial neural network, and MLR: multivariate linear regression) were used to build the FVC model suitable for different growing seasons, growth stages, and crop water stress. The results showed that there was a change in thresholds obtained using the fixed-threshold method based on different image sensors, but this change did not make a big difference on the accuracy of FVCUAV\\\\_R, with the R2 difference of 0.01 and the RMSE difference of 0.01. As for the three FVC regression models, RF model was the most suitable model when these models established in 2018 were used to estimate maize FVC in 2019 for different growth stages and water stress. The low estimation accuracy for high FVC levels was the reason why MLR model could not be used in the other maize growing season. This study provides a low cost and easy way to estimate maize FVC and its inter-field variability under various water status in different maize growing seasons or growth stages.',\n",

Different radar echo patterns represent different disastrous weather, such as hail, severe convection, and so on. Weather radar echo shape prediction can help meteorologists to judge the future changes of disastrous weather, help to avoid the harm of extreme weather to agriculture, and minimize agricultural economic losses. With the application of deep learning in the meteorological field, the deep learning method shows great potential in radar echo prediction. However, there are few research methods to predict the change of weather radar echo shape. This paper presents a radar echo prediction method based on c Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks, which can effectively predict the shape of weather radar echo. The actual data is used to train and test our model. Experiments show that the model can accurately predict the change of echo shape. The quantitative evaluation of the model uses detection probability, false alarm rate, critical success index, and heidke skill score. The average scores predicted by this model in 1.5 h were 0.8223,0.2012,0.6812 and 0.7564, respectively, which were better than those predicted by ConvLSTM and TrajGRU models. The qualitative and quantitative results verify the effectiveness of the model, which shows that the model can be effectively applied to the actual weather forecast and improve the stability of agricultural production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) underscore aquaculture as a sustainable practice. However, many countries rely on ineffective conventional methods to monitor the aquaculture. Fish behaviour monitoring systems lack an integrated strategy, often focusing on underwater footage analysis or water quality data. Additionally, limited research exists on using learning algorithms to identify sensor data anomalies, limiting the effectiveness of such systems. This study proposes a comprehensive and effective aquaculture monitoring system to address these issues. The work introduces a novel method integrating fish motion analysis with water quality metrics. The study also presents a learning system that anticipates potential water quality parameters. The proposed model has the potential to significantly enhance aquaculture management procedures and contribute to the UN’s SDGs through its ability to forecast water quality parameters and detect abnormal behaviour without requiring training detection and tracking algorithms. The study employs a large aquarium to capture water quality parameters and fish movement patterns. The study develops an FPGA-based water quality monitoring system and a prediction model to forecast potential water quality metrics. Among multiple LSTM models, the bi-directional LSTM performs well, achieving an RMSE score of 1.01 for water quality prediction. Subsequently, an outlier detection system is applied to identify unusual water quality parameters, triggering the behaviour analysis model. The behaviour analysis model uses an auto-encoder-based reconstruction approach to detect the frantic patterns in fish. The suggested behaviour analysis model has a f1-score of 0.68, demonstrating its reliability in contrast to conventional methods. The developed system is also tested on aquaculture site videos and includes a novel dataset of Sillago sihama with annotations for frantic behaviour patterns. The system works effectively as a decision support system for aquaculture.',\n",

In the process of far-sea cage aquaculture, the damage of net structure can cause severe economic property losses to farmers, so it is necessary to check the cage's integrity. At present, the typical way to inspect cages is to hire professional divers for manual inspection. This type of inspection is time-consuming and has security concerns. This paper proposes a method for detecting the damage of a far-sea cage based on machine vision and deep learning, which can detect the structure of a far-sea cage in real time and accurately detect the damaged area of the cage. Firstly, the cage image data were collected by autonomous cruising ROV. According to the characteristics of the captured images, an improved multi-scale fusion algorithm was proposed to better the performance of denoising and smoothing effect of the original method. Secondly, we use the MobileNet-SSD and key-frame extraction detection method to detect the damage of underwater cage video. The MobileNet-SSD model has been optimized in model size and detection speed compared with the SSD model. In the experiment, the simulated damaged images of the far-sea cage were used for testing. The experimental results have shown that the scheme can improve the efficiency of far-sea cage inspection and accurately detect the damaged areas in the cage in real-time.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'ABSTRACT Automatic respiration monitoring of dairy cows in modern farming not only helps to reduce manual labor but also increases the automation of health assessment. It is common for cows to congregate on farms, which poses a challenge for manual observation of cow status because they physically occlude each other. In this study, we propose a method that can monitor the respiratory behavior of multiple cows. Initially, 4,000 manually labeled images were used to fine-tune the YOLACT (You Only Look At CoefficienTs) model for recognition and segmentation of multiple cows. Respiratory behavior in the resting state could better reflect their health status. Then, the specific resting states (lying resting, standing resting) of different cows were identified by fusing the convolutional neural network and bidirectional long and short-term memory algorithms. Finally, the corresponding detection algorithms (lying and standing resting) were used for respiratory behavior monitoring. The test results of 60 videos containing different interference factors indicated that the accuracy of respiratory behavior monitoring of multiple cows in 54 videos was {\\\\textgreater}90.00\\\\%, and that of 4 videos was 100.00\\\\%. The average accuracy of the proposed method was 93.56\\\\%, and the mean absolute error and root mean square error were 3.42 and 3.74, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the method was analyzed for simultaneous monitoring of respiratory behavior of multiple cows under movement, occlusion disturbance, and behavioral changes. It was feasible to monitor the respiratory behavior of multiple cows based on the proposed algorithm. This study could provide an a priori technical basis for respiratory behavior monitoring and automatic diagnosis of respiratory-related diseases of multiple dairy cows based on biomedical engineering technology. In addition, it may stimulate researchers to develop robots with health-sensing functions that are oriented toward precision livestock farming.',\n",

In this paper, single shot multibox detector (SSD) with two lightweight backbones MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 were employed to develop an Android APP named KiwiDetector for field kiwifruit detection. An 8-bit quantization method was used to compress model size and improve detection speed by quantizing weight tensor and activation function data of convolutional neural networks from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integer. Detection test was performed on 100 selected kiwifruit field images with resolution of 3,968 × 2,976 pixels using the four models on a HUAWEI P20 smartphone. Results showed that MobileNetV2, quantized MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and quantized InceptionV3 obtained true detected rate (TDR) of 90.8\\\\%, 89.7\\\\%, 87.6\\\\%, and 72.8\\\\%, respectively. The TDR of MobileNetV2 and quantized MobileNetV2 was generally consistent and higher than InceptionV3 and quantized InceptionV3. For processing an image on the smartphone, MobileNetV2, quantized MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and quantized InceptionV3 took about 163 ms, 103 ms, 1085 ms, and 685 ms with model sizes of 17.5 MB, 4.5 MB, 96.1 MB, and 24.1 MB, respectively. Quantized MobileNetV2 reached a significant TDR with the fastest detection speed and the smallest model size. The results indicated that the proposed Android APP is promising for yield estimation.',\n",

When the leaf area is constantly monitored, a plant’s health and productive capacity can be assessed to foment proactive and reactive strategies. Because of that, one of the most critical tasks in agricultural processes is estimating foliar damage. In this sense, we present an automatic method to estimate leaf stress caused by insect herbivory, including damage in border regions. As a novelty, we present a method with well-defined processing steps suitable for numerical analysis and visual inspection of defoliation severity. We describe the proposed method and evaluate its performance concerning 12 different plant species. Experimental results show high assertiveness in estimating leaf area loss with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.98 for grape, soybean, potato, and strawberry leaves. A classic pattern recognition approach, named template matching, is at the core of the method whose performance is compared to cutting-edge techniques. Results demonstrated that the method achieves foliar damage quantification with precision comparable to deep learning models. The code prepared by the authors is publicly available.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Accurate detection of heavy metal stress on the growth status of plants is of great concern for agricultural production and management, food security, and ecological environment. A proximal hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system covered the visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) region of 400–1000 nm coupled with machine learning methods were employed to discriminate the tobacco plants stressed by different concentration of heavy metal Hg. After acquiring hyperspectral images of tobacco plants stressed by heavy metal Hg with concentration solutions of 0 mg·L−1 (non-stressed groups), 1, 3, and 5 mg·L−1 (3 stressed groups), regions of interest (ROIs) of canopy in tobacco plants were identified for spectra processing. Meanwhile, tobacco plant's appearance and microstructure of mesophyll tissue in tobacco leaves were analyzed. After that, clustering effects of the non-stressed and stressed groups were revealed by score plots and score images calculated by principal component analysis (PCA). Then, loadings of PCA and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm were employed to pick effective wavelengths (EWs) for discriminating non-stressed and stressed samples. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) were utilized to estimate the stressed tobacco plants status with different concentrations Hg solutions. The performances of those models were evaluated using confusion matrixes (CMes) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results demonstrated that PLS-DA models failed to offer relatively good result, and this algorithm was abandoned to classify the stressed and non-stressed groups of tobacco plants. Compared to LS-SVM model based on full spectra (FS-LS-SVM), the LS-SVM model established EWs selected by CARS (CARS-LS-SVM) carried 13 variables provided an accuracy of 100\\\\%, which was promising to achieve the qualitative discrimination of the non-stressed and stressed tobacco plants. Meanwhile, for revealing the discrepancy between 3 stressed groups of tobacco plants, the other FS-LS-SVM, PCA-LS-SVM, and CARS-LS-SVM models were setup and offered relatively low accuracies of 55.56\\\\%, 51.11\\\\% and 66.67\\\\%, respectively. Performance of those 3 LS-SVM discriminative models was also poorly performing to differentiate 3 stressed groups of tobacco plants, which might be caused by low concentration of heavy metal and similar canopy (especially in fresh leaves) of plant. The achievements of the research indicated that HSI coupled with machine learning methods had a powerful potential to discriminate tobacco plant stressed by heavy metal Hg.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture has been a main aspect of economics throughout the centuries prior to and after the Industrial Revolution. Agriculture is believed to have been developed at several times in several areas. With global population rapidly increasing, there is a need to increase crop production. Traditional methods used by farmers are not adequate enough to fulfill the requirement. Therefore, farmers are using pesticides and various other harmful products in order to increase their crop production. Agriculture automation is an emerging area and a new theme for every country for a better crop production. Machine learning can be a huge help with this automation needed in agri-technology in order to get more satisfied production without having any adverse effect on the environment or the human body. By making use of machine learning techniques in sensor data, various fields of agriculture are moving into real-time programs by artificial intelligence that are providing a valuable and effective means to farmers in order to take correct decisions and actions. In this chapter, there is a review of the techniques used especially for the wheat crop, including merits and demerits in yield prediction and disease detection in wheat crop. Wheat is the necessary crop product for human beings to live in this world. The chapter concludes by discussing enhancements that can be done in the current techniques in order to predict wheat yield and detect wheat diseases in very early stages.',\n",

This paper presents the design and implementation of a cyber-physical crop irrigation system, based on the intelligent agent concept. The system allows the acquisition of field information through sensors, the application of water according to a decision system and the activation of solenoid valves. Communication capabilities and the performance measurement, the environment, the actuation and sensing systems (PEAS) are explained. Monitoring in the farm or remotely from other locations is achieved with a central station and its internet connectivity. The performance evaluation of the system was made using crop modelling software and an experimental crop in a field located in the large-scale irrigation and drainage district of Chicamocha and Firavitoba (Usochicamocha) in Boyacá – Colombia. The developed system allowed maintaining soil moisture close to field capacity with several irrigation strategies, and avoiding losses and excesses in the use of water resources.',\n",

The developed computer model is fully transformed into peripheral-level software of Internet of Things systems for agricultural purposes. This makes it possible to implement the for-computing architecture of monitoring systems in greenhouses. The obtained research results make it possible to optimise the resources used in growing crops in greenhouse conditions through the implementation of hardware and software intelligent monitoring tools that are adaptive to the types and periods of crop vegetation.

       "  'abstract': 'Achieving the rapid and accurate detection of apple flowers in natural environments is essential for yield estimation and the development of an automatic flower thinner. A real-time apple flower detection method using the channel pruned YOLO v4 deep learning algorithm was proposed. First, the YOLO v4 model under the CSPDarknet53 framework was built, and then, to simplify the apple flower detection model and ensure the efficiency of the model, the channel pruning algorithm was used to prune the model. Finally, a total of 2230 manually labeled apple flower images (including three varieties of Fuji, Red Love, and Gala) were used to fine-tune the model to achieve the fast and accurate detection of apple flowers. The test results showed that the number of parameters of the apple flower detection model after pruning was reduced by 96.74\\\\%, the model size was reduced by 231.51 MB, the inference time was decreased by 39.47\\\\%, and the mAP was 97.31\\\\%, which was only 0.24\\\\% lower than the model before pruning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, five different deep learning algorithms including the Faster R-CNN, Tiny-YOLO v2, YOLO v3, SSD 300 and EfficientDet-D0 were compared. The comparative results showed that the mAP of the apple flower detection using the proposed method was 97.31\\\\%; the detection speed was 72.33f/s; the model size was 12.46 MB; the mAP was 12.21\\\\%, 15.56\\\\%, 14.19\\\\%, 5.67\\\\% and 7.79\\\\% higher than the other five algorithms, respectively; and the detection speed could meet the real-time requirements. Furthermore, the detection performance of apple flowers under different species of apple trees and illumination conditions was discussed. The results indicated that the proposed method had strong robustness to the changes of fruit tree varieties and illumination directions. The results showed that it was feasible to apply the proposed method for the real-time and accurate detection of apple flowers. The research could provide technical references for orchard yield estimation and the development of apple flower thinning robots.',\n",

They may severely damage crop yield, leading to detrimental effects on global food security. The timely and precise detection of leaf diseases is thus crucial for preventing their spread and ensuring the sustainability of agricultural production. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based leaf disease detection model, namely FormerLeaf along with two optimization methods to enhance the model performance. In more detail, we propose the Least Important Attention Pruning (LeIAP) algorithm to select the most important attention heads of each layer in the Transformer model. It could reduce the model size up to 28\\\\% and accelerate the evaluation speed by 15\\\\% with about 3\\\\% accuracy enhancement. In addition, we employ the sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) to calculate matrix correlation in the model. This reduces the model’s complexity from O(n2) to O(n2p), resulting in lowering training time by 10\\\\% while keeping a similar performance. The evaluation results on the Cassava Leaf Disease Dataset show that our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art models in most cases.',\n",

Appropriate modeling methods effectively improve the control performance and efficiency of the greenhouse system and are conducive to the design of water and energy-saving strategies. Meanwhile, the extreme environment could be forecasted in advance, which reduces pests and diseases as well as provides high-quality food. Accordingly, the interest of the scientific community in greenhouse modeling and optimizing has grown considerably. The objective of this work is to provide guidance and insight into the topic by reviewing 73 representative articles and to further support cleaner and sustainable crop production. Compared to the existing literature review, this work details the approaches to improve the greenhouse model in the aspects of parameter identification, structure and process optimization, and multi-model integration to better model complex greenhouse system. Furthermore, a statistical study has been carried out to summarize popular technology and future trends. It was found that dynamic and neural network techniques are most commonly used to establish the greenhouse model and the heuristic algorithm is popular to improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the model. Notably, deep learning, the combination of “knowledge” and “data”, and coupling between the greenhouse system elements have been considered as future valuable development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, artificial intelligence has been widely used in such fields as agricultural informatization, precision agriculture and precision animal husbandry. Due to limited research on deep learning in real-time agricultural and pastoral situations, deep learning and computer vision have become very important topics in the agricultural field. Recent studies have shown that the fusion of features under different attention mechanisms will help advance the utilization of such features, and will thus influence the accuracy and generalization ability of the models used. In this paper, we propose a lightweight network structure based on feature fusion under a dual attention mechanism with the same activation and joint loss functions. More specifically, we propose an innovative method to improve the network structure of two different attention mechanisms, and achieve feature fusion by combining the two. At the same time, we keep the activation functions consistent with those of the original network structure, and we develop a joint loss function to expand the use of various features. We also take the novel approach of applying the trajectory behavior analysis method to walking and standing. Experiments using both a publicly available data set and a data set obtained from a farm show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and generalization ability, as compared to other methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This study addresses the pressing need to enhance food production and quality by tackling the challenge of crop pest recognition. Traditional methods for identifying crop pests are time-consuming and reliant on highly trained experts. To overcome these limitations, this research introduces the Enhanced Metaheuristics with Deep Transfer Learning-based Robust Crop Pest Recognition and Classification (EMDTL-CPRC) model. The EMDTL-CPRC model incorporates several innovative elements, including contrast enhancement to improve image quality, the integration of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with the Residual Network (ResNet) approach as a feature extractor, and the utilization of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method for pest recognition. Furthermore, to enhance the efficacy of the LSTM approach, a Chaotic Salp Swarm Algorithm (CSSA) is incorporated. The simulation results, based on a comprehensive crop pest dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EMDTL-CPRC model in crop pest classification. By enhancing pest recognition accuracy and streamlining the process, this research contributes to the overall goal of improving agricultural crop productivity and ensuring the supply of healthy food.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture’s productivity has decreased in the last decade due to climate change and inappropriate usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticides, which stimulate plant diseases. Plant pathogens are the prime threat to agriculture; diseases causes the development of plant and affects the quality and yield of the crop. To enhance crop yield and quality, early perceive the pathogens and insinuation of the proper medications are essential. Deep learning approaches produce promising results for classifying the input images, and the results vary for many reasons, such as data imbalance and fewer or identical features among other classes of the dataset. In this work, tomato plant disease classification is proposed by using Multilevel Feature Fusion Network (MFFN). It employs ResNet50, MFFN, and Adaptive Attention Mechanism, which combines channel, spatial, and pixel attention to classify the tomato plant leaf images. The proposed deep learning-based approach is trained and tested on a tomato plant leaves dataset and achieved 99.88\\\\% training accuracy, 99.88\\\\% validation accuracy, and 99.83\\\\% external testing accuracy. It outperformed the existing approaches relevant to the tomato plant dataset. Further, this work also proposes a pesticide prescription module that provides pesticide information based on the type of leaf disease.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Determination of apple maturity in orchards is very important to determine the harvest time and postharvest storage conditions. The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to determine the maturity of bagged ‘Fuji’ apples using the starch index as the maturity index. Using the starch index, 846 apples were divided into three maturity levels (immature, harvest maturity, and eatable maturity). Principal component analysis, the random frog (RF) algorithm, and the RF algorithm combined with the successive projection algorithm (RF-SPA) were used to extract the principal components or characteristic wavelengths of the spectral data. Five machine learning algorithms, namely, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), the probabilistic neural network, the extreme learning machine, the partial least squares discrimination analysis, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), were used to develop a calibration model. By comparing the results of different modeling methods, it was determined that the prediction performance of the RF-SPA-LSSVM model based on 15 characteristic wavelengths was the best. The classification accuracy of the prediction set was 89.05\\\\% and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the three types of apples was greater than 0.9210. In addition, four spectral indexes related to the chlorophyll content were used to predict apple maturity. The classification accuracies of the LDA models based on the spectral indexes were 77.63\\\\%–80.95\\\\%, which were lower than that of the calibration model based on the characteristic wavelength. The results show that the maturity of bagged ‘Fuji’ apples can be accurately and nondestructive determined by Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The selected characteristic wavelengths and spectral indexes can provide a reference for development of a nondestructive device for determination of apple maturity.',\n",

Through a detailed survey of research related to sensing technology, we believe that non-contact sensing technology (infrared detection technology, Microwave radiometry technology, Image processing and machine vision, and acoustic detection technology) hold promise for application in intensive livestock production system. Animal welfare has always been a concern of the scientific community, as well as improving production efficiency has been the goal of the intensive livestock industry. With the help of the Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, etc., non-contact sensing technology can better play its role. In this paper, we analyzed the background and technical characteristics of non-contact sensing technology and proposed a new application for applying non-contact sensing technology to intensive livestock farming. These technologies are now gradually being applied and practiced in the livestock industry and will facilitate physiological detection in the intensive livestock industry, potentially protecting animal welfare. The precise adoption of management measures based on better knowledge of animal status can also improve production efficiency.

       "  'abstract': 'Sensors are tools designed to perceive stimuli (input) and respond as measurable output in various forms, useful for us. Advancements in sensor technology in the past two decades have made the life of humans easier and so is the case of managing livestock. Livestock management needs great skills as various kinds of needs of animals are to be satisfied to keep them not only healthy but to secure optimal performance. Sensors help in the improvement of managerial skills at farms depending upon the types and quantum of sensors utilized. It even helps in the standardization of various farm practices leading to efficient energy utilization for thermoregulation and other performance traits. The use of sensors based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) and information technologies (IT) including Internet of Things (IoT) applications has led to the transition of traditional livestock farming into precision livestock farming (PLF) or smart animal agriculture. The majority of the early developed sensors focused on the economic performance of animals, i.e., production, physiology, health, reproduction, etc., however recently, the focus has shifted to cover behavior and welfare traits as well to address the rising concerns of industrial livestock production, through estimation of animal welfare indicators (AWIs), especially with the emergence of biosensors. Though there are hundreds of sensor-based tools available in the market, the validation part still needs major impetus. Use of sensors in the livestock sector has remained restricted to date due to the requirement of additional infrastructure, moderate to higher skills for use and interpretation of outcomes, financial constraints especially at small herds, shortage of sensor availability, etc., as mostly seen in under-developed and developing countries. Issues related to the wider use of sensor technologies such as unemployment, livestock welfare, and others, seem to fade away with benefits overweighing the concerns due to parallel industrialization and the evolution of cheaper sensor tools. Thus, the trend of slower adoption of PLF seems to reverse in the near future due to the rise of e-literacy across the globe (more rapidly due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic), the reduction of cost of sensors and IT tools, the rise of specialized farming, shortage of skilled labor, etc.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Convolutional neural networks, as a type of deep learning approach, have revolutionized the field of computer vision and pattern recognition through state of the art performance in a large number of classification tasks. Machine learning has been recently incorporated into intelligent systems related to agricultural and food production to decrease manual processing when dealing with large number of operations. Feedforward artificial neural networks such as convolutional neural networks can be used in agriculture for the segmentation and classification of images containing objects of interests such as fruits, or leaves. It is however unknown what is the best architecture to use, if it is necessary to propose new architectures, and what is the impact of the input feature space on the classification performance. In this paper, we propose to detect two types of grapes (Albariño white grapes and Barbera red grapes) in images. We investigate 1) the impact of the input feature space: color images, grayscale images, and color histograms using convolutional neural networks; 2) the impact of the parameters such as the size of the blocks, and the impact of data augmentation; 3) the performance of 11 pre-trained deep learning architectures, i.e. using a transfer learning approach for the classification. The results support the conclusion that images of grapes can be efficiently segmented using different feature spaces where color images provide the best performance. With convolutional neural networks using transfer learning, the best performance is achieved with Resnet networks reaching an accuracy of 99\\\\% for both red and white grapes. Finally, data augmentation, image normalization, and the input feature space have a key impact on the overall performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Weeds are mainly spread by weed seeds being mixed with agricultural and forestry crop seeds, grain, animal hair, and other plant products, and disturb the growing environment of target plants such as crops and wild native plants. The accurate and efficient classification of weed seeds is important for the effective management and control of weeds. However, classification remains mainly dependent on destructive sampling-based manual inspection, which has a high cost and rather low flux. We considered that this problem could be solved using a nondestructive intelligent image recognition method. First, on the basis of the establishment of the image acquisition system for weed seeds, images of single weed seeds were rapidly and completely segmented, and a total of 47 696 samples of 140 species of weed seeds and foreign materials remained. Then, six popular and novel deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are compared to identify the best method for intelligently identifying 140 species of weed seeds. Of these samples, 33 600 samples are randomly selected as the training dataset for model training, and the remaining 14 096 samples are used as the testing dataset for model testing. AlexNet and GoogLeNet emerged from the quantitative evaluation as the best methods. AlexNet has strong classification accuracy and efficiency (low time consumption), and GoogLeNet has the best classification accuracy. A suitable CNN model for weed seed classification could be selected according to specific identification accuracy requirements and time costs of applications. This research is beneficial for developing a detection system for weed seeds in various applications. The resolution of taxonomic issues and problems associated with the identification of these weed seeds may allow for more effective management and control.',\n",

In this study, a framework for facilitating the prediction of the pest incidence in organic banana crops is developed. To achieve this, a data acquisition system with smart sensors is implemented to monitor the meteorological variables that influence the growth of the pests. The proposed framework is utilised for the assessment of various mathematical representations of the pest incidence. These models are adapted from population growth functions and built in such way as to predict the behaviour of the insects at non-regular time intervals. A hybrid approach, combining mechanistic and data-based methods is utilised for the development of the models. Both linear and nonlinear dynamic relationships with the temperature are assumed. The results show that nonlinear model representations have greater accuracy (a fit index of more than 70\\\\%), which provides a basis for improving pest management actions on the organic banana farms.',\n",

Different infectious and non-infectious agents can cause similar symptoms in plant organs. Diagnosing diseases is crucial, but it remains an inherently manual and error-prone task. Many works have been proposed to diagnose plant diseases, mainly using machine learning approaches. Even though this field affects agribusiness areas, little has been done to classify and map the current literature. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the current literature, and draw some research gaps, trends, and challenges that are worth investigating. A systematic mapping of the literature was carried out in pairs, following well-established practice guidelines. In total, 56 primary studies were carefully selected from a sample of 668 papers, which were retrieved from 9 widely recognized electronic databases. They were analyzed and categorized to answer seven research questions. The results show that 41\\\\% of primary studies applied machine learning techniques to detect diseases, 32\\\\% used image sensors to identify symptoms related to plant diseases, 30\\\\% focused on proposing new models of machine learning to detect diseases 34\\\\% were evaluation studies, and 71\\\\% were published in scientific journals.

       "  'abstract': 'Accurate count of fruits is important for producers to make adequate decisions in production management. Although some algorithms based on machine vision have been developed to count fruits which were all implemented by tracking fruits themselves, those algorithms often make mismatches or even lose targets during the tracking process due to the large number of highly similar fruits in appearance. This study aims to develop an automated video processing method for improving the counting accuracy of apple fruits in orchard environment with modern vertical fruiting-wall architecture. As the trunk is normally larger than fruits and appears clearly in the video, the trunk is thus selected as a single-object tracking target to reach a higher accuracy and higher speed tracking than the commonly used method of fruit-based multi-object tracking. This method was trained using a YOLOv4-tiny network integrated with a CSR-DCF (channel spatial reliability-discriminative correlation filter) algorithm. Reference displacement between consecutive frames was calculated according to the frame motion trajectory for predicting possible fruit locations in terms of previously detected positions. The minimum Euclidean distance of detected fruit position and the predicted fruit position was calculated to match the same fruits between consecutive video frames. Finally, a unique ID was assigned to each fruit for counting. Results showed that mean average precision of 99.35\\\\% for fruit and trunk detection was achieved in this study, which could provide a good basis for fruit accurate counting. A counting accuracy of 91.49\\\\% and a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.9875 with counting performed by manual counting were reached in orchard videos. Besides, proposed counting method can be implemented on CPU at 2 ∼ 5 frames per second (fps). These promising results demonstrate the potential of this method to provide yield data for apple fruits or even other types of fruits.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Deep learning is the state-of-the-art application of machine learning in many fields, and this technology has also been applied in agriculture. A large quantity of data needs to be provided to the deep learning models in the training procedure; however, sufficient data may not be provided when considering agriculture applications. Transfer learning, which is a learning strategy for rapid and easy adaptation of a pre-trained model, can be a solution for limited agricultural data. Therefore, the objective of this study is to verify the adaptability of a pre-trained model that predicts the environmental variables of a greenhouse by retraining the model with data from a new cultivation condition, using the transfer learning technique. As a result, the transfer learning methodology was applied to five common deep learning models. Twenty-seven greenhouses (14 sweet peppers and 13 tomato cultivations) in various regions of South Korea provided the experimental dataset to this research. The analyzed environmental variables are the internal temperature, relative humidity, radiation, CO2 concentration, and external temperature. Before the transfer learning procedure is conducted, some layers from pre-trained models were replaced with new layers. The model was, thereafter, re-trained with a new test dataset. The best model in the training procedure was BiLSTM, resulting in an average R2 of 0.69. The models could predict the tendencies of the environmental changes, indicating that they were adequately trained. The most accurate deep-learning model considering the transfer dataset was the transferred BiLSTM, with an average R2 of 0.78 and 0.81 for sweet pepper and tomato datasets, respectively. The accuracies of most transferred models are higher than those of the corresponding deep-learning models. As a result, transfer learning can be used to adapt previously trained deep-learning models, enabling them to predict the microclimates of a greenhouse with scarce data. Furthermore, advanced transfer learning strategies would increase the performance of the transferred models analyzed in this study.',\n",

While best known for being the core of the artificial intelligence (AI) world’s best Go game player, RL has a vast range of potential applications. RL may help to address some of the criticisms leveled against crop management decision support systems (DSS): it is an interactive, geared towards action, contextual tool to evaluate series of crop operations faced with uncertainties. A review of RL use for crop management DSS reveals a limited number of contributions. We profile key prospects for a human-centered, real-world, interactive RL-based system to face tomorrow’s agricultural decisions, and theoretical and ongoing practical challenges that may explain its current low uptake. We argue that a joint research effort from the RL and agronomy communities is necessary to explore RL’s full potential.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this research, an attention-based depthwise separable neural network with Bayesian optimization (ADSNN-BO) is proposed to detect and classify rice disease from rice leaf images. Rice diseases frequently result in 20–40\\\\% corp production loss in yield and is highly related to the global economy. Rapid disease identification is critical to plan treatment promptly and reduce the corp losses. Rice disease diagnosis is still mainly performed manually. To achieve AI assisted rapid and accurate disease detection, we proposed the ADSNN-BO model based on MobileNet structure and augmented attention mechanism. Moreover, Bayesian optimization method is applied to tune hyper-parameters of the model. Cross-validated classification experiments are conducted based on a public rice disease dataset with four categories in total. The experimental results demonstrate that our mobile compatible ADSNN-BO model achieves a test accuracy of 94.65\\\\%, which outperforms all of the state-of-the-art models tested. To check the interpretability of our proposed model, feature analysis including activation map and filters visualization approach are also conducted. Results show that our proposed attention-based mechanism can more effectively guide the ADSNN-BO model to learn informative features.

       "  'abstract': 'Deep learning (DL) has gradually taken the lead as the most effective approach in the agricultural fields due to the early identification and classification of plant species and diseases for improving the quality of crop production because of recent technological breakthroughs, which have had a significant impact on agriculture. Plenty of complicated problems in farming, including species classification, plant disorder identification, yield approximation, and weather and soil moisture prediction, are made simple using deep neural networks. Thus, this proposed study aims to classify Brassica Napus (B. Napus) rapeseed species based on their most significant features, like flowers, leaves, and packets. The study has adopted two types of rapeseed such as B. Rapa and B. Alba. Five contemporary deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have also been assessed for distinguishing rapeseed species. These models are DenseNet201, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, and ResNet50. Initially, the researchers collected data from the agricultural field, and then image pre-processing is performed to create our dataset. After that, CNN models were applied to this dataset and enumerated the experimental data accordingly. Our DenseNet201 model successfully classified both species with the highest accuracy of 100\\\\% for flowers and 97\\\\% for both packets and leaves. A comprehensive analysis with companion studies confirmed the efficacy of our preferred paradigm for the near future. Nevertheless, future studies will compare these methodologies to data from a separate metabolomics dataset from comparable crops.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Research on diagnosis of crop diseases and pests becomes a hot topic of the application of artificial intelligence technology in smart agriculture. Plant electronic medical records (PEMRs) formed by Beijing Plant Clinic provides a new idea for the diagnosis and prevention of crop diseases and pests. PEMRs are stored in the form of heterogeneous data, containing a wealth of plant information, disease and pest information, and environmental information. Therefore, it is urgent to mine the information in PEMRs and employ it to assist in intelligent prescription recommendation. This paper divides prescription recommendation into two sub-tasks, diagnosis and medication, and transforms this problem into a recommendation problem based on multi-task learning, with the goal of establishing a single model to realize learning multi-task simultaneously. Firstly, the correlation analysis of tasks and features is carried out using methods such as knowledge graph. Further, according to the sequential dependency between tasks, a novel cascaded multi-task crop prescription recommendation method based on Shared-Bottom and MMoE (Shared-MMoE) model is proposed, and each task is optimized by gating network. A PEMRs dataset containing 8 diseases, 9 pests and 32 medicines was constructed for model verification. Compared with the baseline model, the experiments showed that Shared-MMoE could significantly improve the quality and accuracy of prescription recommendation. The AUC of diagnosis task and medication task reached 96.33\\\\% and 95.36\\\\%, respectively. In conclusion, our study preliminarily explored the potential application of artificial intelligence in the research of crop diseases and pests based on PEMRs and multi-task learning.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Irrigation is very important for ensuring food security and reducing crop production vulnerability caused by the lack of rain. Sustainable irrigation is the rational practice of all the activities related to water application on the crops. In irrigation, the rationality of intelligent agents can be used to reach soil water content near the field capacity to increase yields and reduce waste of water. Rationality in artificial intelligence is the capability of the intelligent agents to decide their actions. This paper discusses how incorporating intelligent agents on irrigation systems allows significant advances in respect of current irrigation approaches. This paper review not only focuses on intelligent reactive systems as usual, but rather discloses developments in systems that incorporate other behaviors such as proactivity, planning, learning, social abilities, organization, coordination and negotiation. From the literature review, it is found that the use of soil, plant and environmental sensors, as well as reasoning, learning and communication capabilities, provides innovative technological support to improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows that intelligent agents can adequately consider the timing and the amount of water to apply according to the spatio-temporal variations of the soil–plant–atmosphere system. It is concluded that significant improvements in water savings and crop yield can be achieved incorporating artificial intelligence into precision irrigation. Further research is needed on irrigation scheduling based on multi-agent systems at different scales of agricultural production systems.',\n",

However, convolutional neural network-aided machine learning approaches are data-intensive, with model accuracy subject to the input image quality. Underwater imagery data acquisition, relatively high fish density, and water turbidity impart major challenges in acquiring high-quality imagery data. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of sensor selection, image quality, data size, imaging conditions, and pre-processing operations on the machine learning model accuracy for fish detection under RAS production conditions. An imaging platform (RASense1.0) was developed with four off-the-shelf sensors customized for underwater image acquisition. Data acquired from the imaging sensors under two light conditions (i.e., Ambient and Supplemental) were arranged in sets of 100 images and annotated as partial and whole fish. The annotated images were augmented and trained using a one-stage YOLOv5 model. There was a substantial improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and F1 score while increasing the size of the image datasets up to 700 images and 80 epochs. Similarly, image augmentation substantially improved model accuracy for smaller dataset models trained with less than 700 images. Beyond this, there was no improvement in mAP (∼86 \\\\%). Sensor selection significantly affected model precision, recall, and mAP; however, light conditions did not demonstrate a considerable effect on model accuracy. While comparing the performance of the one-stage YOLOv5 against a two-stage Faster R-CNN, both models performed similarly in terms of mAP scores; however, training time for the former was 6–14 times lower than the latter.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Frost events incur substantial economic losses to farmers. These events could induce damage to plants and crops by damaging the cells. In this article, a recurrent neural network-based method, automating the frost prediction process, is proposed. The recurrent neural network-based models leveraged in this article include the standard recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit. The proposed method aims to increase the prediction frequency from once per 12–24 h for the next day or night events to minute-wise predictions for the next hour events. To achieve this goal, datasets from NSW and ACT of Australia are obtained. The experiments are designed considering the scene of deploying the model to the Internet of Things systems. Factors such as model processing speed, long-term error and data availability are reviewed. After model construction, there are three experiments. The first experiment tests the errors between different model types. The second and third experiments test the effect of sequence length on error and performance for recurrent neural network-based models. All tests introduce artificial neural network models as the baseline. Also, all tests for model error are conducted in two rounds with testing datasets from the current year (2016) and next year (2017). As a result, recurrent neural network-based models are more suitable for short-term deployment with a smaller sequence length. In contrast, artificial neural network models demonstrate a lower error over the long term with faster processing time. With the results presented, the limitations of the proposed method are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Crop disease in the plant is a significant issue in the agriculture sector, and it is currently very difficult to detect these illnesses in crop leaves. The foundation of the global economy is agriculture. India ranks second in the production of tomatoes worldwide. The tomato crop is affected by various diseases which lead to a reduction in product quality and quantity. The advancement in computer vision and deep learning opens up the door for predicting diseases that appear in the crops. The aim of this paper is classification among 10 different categories of tomato plant leaves using the proposed novel TomConv model which deploys an improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For this purpose, the publicly available dataset called PlantVillage comprising of more than 16000 images of tomato leaves, both diseased and healthy was used for the experimentation purpose. The proposed model is the simplest model among all the available state-of-the-art models. The tomato leaf images were preprocessed for reducing the size in 150 × 150 dimension. The model constitutes four layered CNN followed by a max pooling layer. The model splits the corpus into training and validation datasets in 80:20 ratio, is trained under 105 epochs for tomato leaf images, and achieved an accuracy of 98.19\\\\%. The proposed model is compared with existing models under different parameters such as no. of classes, no. of layers, and accuracy. The results are promising as they outperform all the available state-of-the-art models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The evolution of agriculture towards intensive farming leads to an increasing demand for animal identification associated with high traceability, driven by the need for quality control and welfare management in agricultural animals. Automatic identification of individual animals is an important step to achieve individualised care in terms of disease detection and control, and improvement of the food quality. For example, as feeding patterns can differ amongst pigs in the same pen, even in homogenous groups, automatic registration shows the most potential when applied to an individual pig. In the EU for instance, this capability is required for certification purposes. Although the RFID technology has been gradually developed and widely applied for this task, chip implanting might still be time-consuming and costly for current practical applications. In this paper, a novel framework composed of computer vision algorithms, machine learning and deep learning techniques is proposed to offer a relatively low-cost and scalable solution of pig recognition. Firstly, pig faces and eyes are detected automatically by two Haar feature-based cascade classifiers and one shallow convolutional neural network to extra high-quality images. Secondly, face recognition is performed by employing a deep convolutional neural network. Additionally, class activation maps generated by grad-CAM and saliency maps are utilised to visually understand how the discriminating parameters have been learned by the neural network. By applying the proposed approach on 10 randomly selected pigs filmed in farm condition, the proposed method demonstrates the superior performance against the state-of-art method with an accuracy of 83\\\\% over 320 testing images. The outcome of this study will facilitate the real-application of AI-based animal identification in swine production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Former and accurate prediction of the crop yield is vital for statistical as well as economic valuation on the farm levels to govern investment plans in agricultural products. Among the difficult problems in the agricultural industry, crop yield predictions performed to forecast the higher yield of crops using artificial intelligence techniques faces more complications. Considering the increasing significance of crop yield predictions, this paper proposes a new crop yield prediction model by utilizing hybrid classification model based on the improved feature ranking fusion process. In this model, initially the unnecessary data is cleansed by Data Normalization and subsequentl By an improved SMOTE algorithm is proposed that enhances the data to make it proper for feature extraction. The data features are essential to analyses the respective in-depth information, hence, the feature extraction process includes the extraction of Improved Correlation based features, Statistical features, Entropy features and Raw Data. In order to ensure the selection of most important features, it is necessary to make optimal feature selection. Therefore, an improved feature ranking fusion process is employed to choose the suitable features, in which, the results of three feature selection methods like chi-square, Relief and RFE are included. Finally, the prediction process is carried out by the proposed hybrid model, which is the combination of LSTM and DBN models. Finally, the performance of proposed work is validated in terms of accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and then the results show that compared to the conventional classifiers such as LSTM, DBN, CNN, Bi-GRU, SVM, respectively.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sudden outbreaks of crop pests (insect pests and diseases) are increasing in Korea due to climate change and globalization. To prevent such outbreaks, it is necessary to predict and control pest occurrences in advance. Crop pests have been predicted through process-based or statistical modeling; however, the limitations of these models, which rely solely on historically acquired domain knowledge and data, have become increasingly prominent owing to climate change and rapidly changing agricultural ecosystems. To overcome these limitations, artificial neural network (ANN)-based models that use continuous pest survey data in the field have been investigated over the last decade. However, because pest survey data are collected by humans through process-mediated methods, fundamental problems exist in terms of data quality and size that may hinder the performance of the resulting ANN-based models. In this study, to determine the minimum pest data size required to ensure the optimal performance of ANN-based models, we developed feed-forward neural network models for 19 rice pests using 23 pest datasets collected from 149 districts by the Rural Development Administration of Korea over 19 years (2002–2020). Using each ANN-based model, the minimum data size required for the highest model performance achieved in this study was determined for all 19 rice pests. Furthermore, we developed a decision-tree rule to estimate the minimum data size based on the selected characteristics of each pest. The final Decision tree rule, based on the distinction between diseases and insect pests and the balance of pest data (the relative ratio of pest occurrence data to non-occurrence data), showed a relatively good performance (70.24 \\\\%) in the 3-fold cross-validation test. Overall, these results indicate that the minimum data sizes required for ANN modeling vary among rice pests, depending on the pest data characteristics, as indicated by the Decision tree rule developed in this study.',\n",

During crop production, crops are susceptible to insects. The identification and treatment of these insects have become a severe issue. The optimal way to reduce this cost is by early detection of the insects and taking appropriate measures to minimize the damage to crop plants. However, the traditional method lacks to examine the diseases and insects' presence in real-time. This study provides deep learning-based solutions for real-time identification and detection of insects in the Soybean crop.

Finally, major challenges and countermeasures for orchard yield prediction and estimation are discussed. Complicated natural environments with inconsistent horticultural management practices are still critical challenges for large scale commercialization of researched yield prediction methods. Therefore, combination of engineering technology optimization and standardization of agronomic management practices are necessary to realize automatic operation in complex agricultural fields.

       "  'abstract': 'Yellow vein mosaic virus (YVMV) is a destructive plant virus that commonly affects crops, particularly okra, in India. The virus is transmitted by whiteflies and poses significant challenges to agricultural productivity. Infection with YVMV leads to distinct yellow vein patterns on leaves, stunted growth, reduced yield, and ultimately economic losses for farmers. Timely and accurate detection of YVMV is crucial for effective disease management. In this article, we present a novel method that employs advanced deep-learning models to identify YVMV-infected okra plants. The study leverages a dataset of over 2000 okra plant leaves that implements transfer learning models, including MobileNet, EfficientNet, InceptionV3, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50 and recurrent neural networks (RNN) variants, including Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and Gated recurrent unit (GRU). Additionally, three hybrid models, combining MobileNet with LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, are incorporated to capitalize on the characteristics of both MobileNet and RNNs through superior feature extraction and detection of temporal dependencies. The results demonstrate that the MobileNet model combined with all three RNNs achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing 99.27\\\\%. Notably, the MobileNet model integrated with GRU exhibits the most optimized performance with the least loss and greatest accuracy, facilitating improved disease management strategies and aiding in the yield of crops by reducing the impact of YVMV.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Premium maize varieties are the focus of attention of farmers, breeders, food manufacturers, and people in other industries. Maize seed fraud causes huge financial losses to these industries and many varieties are difficult to distinguish due to their similar appearance. Hyperspectral imaging, as a powerful tool for rapid non-destructive testing, combined with traditional pattern recognition/classification algorithms, has had many successful reports in seed variety identification. In practice, however, fake varieties are too complex to enumerate and a new fake variety may be developed at any time, posing a serious challenge to existing variety identification models. In view of this, this paper proposes a deep one-class learning (OCL) network for seed fraud detection. Specifically, it trains a hypersphere with minimum-volume that can enclose the real variety and isolate all fake varieties outside the hypersphere. In order to improve the performance and stability of the model, the spectral and spatial information of seeds are fused, and a band attention module is used to amplify the weights of the effective bands to suppress the interference from redundant bands. The experimental results show that our method has a mean accuracy of 93.70\\\\% for receiving real varieties and 94.28\\\\% for rejecting fake varieties, which is superior to several existing state-of-the-art OCL models.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Efficient and accurate monitoring crop growth is an important prerequisite for modern greenhouse crop growth control and management. However, it is still challenging to achieve efficient in coordinated detection of tomato organs. Therefore, in this study, a multiobjective detection model was established to detect the blossom, fruit, and fruit color of crop population under dense planting, leaf shading, fruit overlap, and interference from light change in greenhouses. Specifically, sample equalization, random transformation, and mosaic enhancement were applied to identify multiple targets and small-sample images. A new detection network, YOLOX, was used, which introduces a decoupled head structure and redesigns a detection head according to the anchor-free concept to effectively improve the recognition of small-target occlusion. An efficient tomato flower and fruit recognition model was constructed based on a two-step fine-tuned multi-round optimization strategy training. The results showed that the YOLOX target detection model improved the average recognition accuracy (mAP) by 52.49–10.75 \\\\%, was lighter, was only 14 \\\\% original YOLOv4, and improved the detection speed by 25.53 FPS compared to six main target detection algorithms. It can be used as a method for the collaborative recognition of tomato flowers and fruits. Accordingly, two sets of lightweight detection networks with different performances were designed according to different agricultural scenarios. YOLOXMOB modeled with a small size (only 34.2 MB), high mAP of 81.39 \\\\%, and detection speed of 61.85 FPS. It is recommended for use as a deployment model for mobile devices. YOLOXPC, with a deep network layer and strong performance, achieved 86.16 \\\\% mAP, and is recommended for monitoring and dispatching computers.

Automatic identification and classification of weeds can play a vital role in weed management contributing to better crop yields. Intelligent and smart spot-spraying system's efficiency relies on the accuracy of the computer vision based detectors for autonomous weed control. In the present study, feasibility of deep learning based techniques (Alexnet, GoogLeNet, InceptionV3, Xception) were evaluated in weed identification from RGB images of bell pepper field. The models were trained with different values of epochs (10, 20,30), batch sizes (16, 32), and hyperparameters were tuned to get optimal performance. The overall accuracy of the selected models varied from 94.5 to 97.7\\\\%. Among the models, InceptionV3 exhibited superior performance at 30-epoch and 16-batch size with a 97.7\\\\% accuracy, 98.5\\\\% precision, and 97.8\\\\% recall. For this Inception3 model, the type 1 error was obtained as 1.4\\\\% and type II error was 0.9\\\\%.

       "  'abstract': 'The classification of fish species has important practical significance for both the aquaculture industry and ordinary people. However, existing methods for classifying marine and freshwater fishes have poor feature extraction ability and do not meet actual needs. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for multi-water fish classification (Fish-TViT) based on transfer learning and visual transformers. Fish-TViT uses a label smoothing loss function to solve the problem of overfitting and overconfidence of the classifier. We also employ Gradient-weighted Category Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technology to visualize and understand the features of the model and the areas on which the decision depends, which guides the optimization of the model architecture. We first crop and clean fish images, and then use data augmentation to expand the number of training datasets. A pre-trained visual transformer model is used to extract enhanced features of fish images, which are subsequently cropped into a series of flat patches. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron is used to predict fish species. Experimental results show that Fish-TViT achieves high classification accuracy on both low-resolution marine fish data (94.33\\\\%) and high-resolution freshwater fish data (98.34\\\\%). Compared with traditional convolutional neural networks, Fish-TViT has better performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Plant disease has a considerable influence on the safety of grain output and quality. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and diagnose plant diseases. Most plant diseases are reflected in plant leaves, and accurate identification of plant diseases require specialized knowledge. Generally, it is difficult for farmers to accurately identify plant disease. Consequently, accurate and timely automatic recognition of plant disease is extremely needed in the area of precision agricultural. To solving this challenge, many classical computer vision and deep learning-based research models have been proposed. Due to the successful performance, deep learning became the preferred approach for plant disease identification. We design a novel transformer block by use of transformer architecture to model long-range features, and of soft split token embedding to capture local information from surrounding pixels and patches, in this paper. Furthermore, inception architecture and cross channel feature learning can improve the information richness, which is especially beneficial to fine-grained feature learning. The proposed model obtains higher accuracy than previous convolution and vision transformer-based models, achieves 99.94\\\\% accuracy on VillagePlant, 99.22\\\\% accuracy on ibean, 86.89\\\\% accuracy on AI2018, and 77.54\\\\% accuracy on PlantDoc.

       "  'abstract': \"The image-based fish feeding status analysis has the potential to bring the aquaculture industry a more intelligent and precise feeding process. However, most of this type of research currently is predicated on a fully supervised approach that not only requires experienced experts for sample labeling, but also the process appears to be time consuming and resource intensive. This makes it very difficult to obtain labeled samples. To solve this problem, we proposed a model method that combines the VGG16 network with active learning to reduce the number of labeled samples needed in the analysis of fish feeding status. The algorithm is composed of two modules: feature extraction classifier and information extractor. In addition, multiple training strategies such as Mish activation function and RAdam optimizer were used in the feature extraction classifier to improve the classification performance. Optimal selection of information entropy method was used to obtain the most informative samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we designed a fish feeding experiment and verified the performance of the proposed algorithm with a special focus on the accuracy and the number of labeled samples required. The results showed that the proposed algorithm has achieved satisfying results in accuracy (the test accuracy is 98\\\\%) and the number of labeled samples (approximately 1/10 of the original dataset). Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can be applied to aquaculture production to provide a reference for farmers' feeding operations.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The acquisition of information on fish stress has been recognized as an urgent need for monitoring water quality, preventing disease, and improving welfare. Minimizing the potential stress-related impact on fish health has attracted public attention by effectively and reliably identifying early signs of stress response in intensive aquaculture. To date, fish stress has been mainly monitored, identified, and evaluated manually, which is time-consuming, laborious, insufficient, and unreliable. Recently, intelligent methods and equipment create new opportunities for the automatic recognition of abnormal states involving behavioral and physiological stress responses of fish. This study reviewed the relevant articles on fish stress monitoring and summarized that the novel technologies were sorted into three categories: machine vision-based, sensor-based, and acoustic-based methods. All methods were assessed for their applications, advantages, and disadvantages, respectively. It is concluded that advanced sensors and machine learning-based methods are essential for accelerating the automation and intelligence of fish welfare monitoring technology. This paper proposes that the information fusion and deep learning algorithms have the potential to further improve the accuracy of future research on abnormal behavior recognition in smart fish farming.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Analyzing fish shoal behaviors is one of the concerned problems for scientists who study fish welfare and stress. However, most shoal behavior exploring methods with manual parameters are subjective and not widely available in various conditions. Therefore, this study introduced graph technology, built 29,505 shoal behavioral graphs and presented a graph neural network for analyzing four shoal behaviors (normal, resting, abnormal, and circular state) by calculating the multiple swimming indexes and swimming posture from videos. In the proposed model, motion characteristics of the shoal and swimming posture of individuals in shoal were utilized to construct a shoal graph, and then the graph convolution network (GCN) model was trained and tested. Results indicated that the model could effectively improve the identification rate of fish shoals’ special behaviors, with an overall accuracy of 97.3\\\\% under the ideal condition, 92.3\\\\% for the practicable scheme that track fish by machine learning technology, compared with the artificial neural network, modified kinetic energy model and simulation feature point selection model, the accuracy of special behaviors increased by 1.6\\\\%, 57.7\\\\%, and 34.0\\\\%, respectively. Besides, the main factors that affected the accuracy of the analyzer were explored. The analyzer is sensitive to (1) the precision of tracking results, (2) edge connection in the graph and (3) features of the model’s input. In addition, by interpreting the principle of the GCN model, it assigns greater weights for dispersion in normal swimming state recognition, and swimming postures are the most significant indicators to determine whether a shoal is in an abnormal state or not. In summary, the model can be used to help researchers explore the basal behavioral mechanisms in aquaculture.',\n",

Moreover, when the concentration of ammonia nitrogen starts to accumulate, it is a judgment standard to provide early warning through the changes in fish behavior to prevent excessive ammonia nitrogen in water. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach to monitoring water quality for aquaculture based on deep learning and three-dimensional movement trajectory. The improved YOLOv8 model was used as the object detection approach to obtain three-dimensional position information of fish by combining Kalman filter, Kuhn Munkres (KM) algorithm, and Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) algorithm. The proposed approach was evaluated in the recovery experiment of acute ammonia nitrogen stress of sturgeon, bass, and crucian. The experimental results show that the precision, recall, mAP@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of the improved YOLOv8 model are 0.964, 0.914, 0.979, and 0.602, respectively. In addition, the proposed three-dimensional positioning approach can qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the fish behavior in different stages and further explores the fish behavior changes through behavior trajectories, volumes of exercise, spatial distribution, and movement velocity. This research provides a new method and idea for studying the abnormal behavior of aquatic animals under ammonia nitrogen stress and has theoretical and practical significance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pest monitoring of forest areas is essential to pest control. The existing remote sensing satellite image methods have been widely used in detecting pine wilt disease due to their low cost and large detection range. However, most existing methods for pine wilt disease detection are based on multi-phase remote sensing satellite imagery and use manually designed features or machine learning-based algorithms. This makes these methods time-consuming and does not allow early detection of pest-infested forests and can also lead to further spread of the disease. In addition, machine learning-based algorithms can have poor detection performance and generalization ability. To address these shortcomings, this paper uses the pine forest in the Qingyuan area of Liaoning Province in China as a study area to analyze the physiological characteristics of pine pests based on the aerial photography data collected by a Quadrotor-type unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). By combining these data with the artificial field survey data, the pest-infested areas of forest are marked in the Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing (SRS) images. Further, an end-to-end automatic pest detection framework is designed based on a multi-scale attention-UNet (MA-UNet) model and monophasic images. In addition, the detection performance of the developed model is further optimized using the data augmentation technique to extend the labeled dataset. Compared with the traditional model, the proposed model achieves a much better recall rate of 57.38\\\\% in detecting pest-infested forest areas, while the recall rates of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), UNet, attention-UNet, and MedT models are 14.38\\\\%, 49.33\\\\%, 48.02\\\\%, and 33.64\\\\%, respectively. According to the results, the proposed model can achieve timely detection and screening of pest-infested forest areas, improving forest management efficiency.',\n",

The traditional methods and deep learning methods in computer vision technology are further summarized for their application approaches in these three research types, and the commonly used classical algorithm models in abnormal fish detection are introduced comprehensively. In addition, this paper summarizes several common methods for obtaining public datasets in aquaculture and evaluation indicators of model accuracy, emphasizing two methods for researchers to collect experimental on-site data.

These methods to predict fruit production are applicable in developing countries because they can compare production with increasing populations and assist in making new policies to increase production. The estimated results reveal that the government of Pakistan needs to further increase fruit production and create better policies for farmers to improve their production.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rapid and non-destructive variety identification is essential for screening maize seeds for different end-uses such as food, feed, and breeding. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is one of the most commonly used techniques in such seed classification. Typically, after acquiring hyperspectral images of seeds, the spectral domain signals need to be preprocessed and a classifier need to be designed. The traditional method is to find a appropriate spectral preprocessing method through trial-and-error experiment, which is time-consuming, laborious and has high risk of misuse preprocessing. In view of this, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning method that includes pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In the pre-training phase, a model was trained on the unlabeled raw spectral data in an unsupervised manner to obtain general representations. In the fine-tuning phase, the pre-trained model was fine-tuned with the goal of the seed classification task and trained in a supervised manner on labeled spectral data. Experimental results showed that the proposed method did not rely on spectral preprocessing, and its performance was superior to other existing seed classification methods. In addition, the self-supervised pre-trained model significantly outperformed the non-pre-trained model in the downstream seed classification task, and obtained good generalization ability. Overall, this method combined with HSI for seed quality evaluation has broad application prospects.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'CONTEXT Mapping crop types from satellite images is a promising application in agricultural systems. However, it is a challenge to automate in-season crop type mapping over a large area because of the insufficiency of ground truth and issues of scalability, reusability, and accessibility of the classification model. This study introduces a framework for automatic crop type mapping using spatiotemporal crop information and Sentinel-2 data based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). The main advantage of the framework is using the trusted pixels extracted from the historical Cropland Data Layer (CDL) to replace ground truth and label training samples in satellite images. OBJECTIVE This paper will achieve three objectives: (1) assessing spatiotemporal crop information derived from the historical crop cover maps; (2) mapping crop cover, mainly crop fields without regular historical crop rotation patterns, from remote sensing data using supervised learning classification and validating mapping results; and (3) automating in-season crop mapping and exploring the scalability of the framework. METHODS The proposed crop mapping workflow consists of four stages. The data preparation stage preprocesses CDL and Sentinel-2 data into the required structure. The spatiotemporal crop information sampling stage extracts trusted pixels from the historical CDL time series and labels Sentinel-2 data. Then a crop type classification model can be trained using the supervised learning classifier in the model training stage. In the mapping/validation stage, an in-season crop cover map over the full Sentinel-2 tile will be produced using the trained model and the classification performance will be validated using CDL or other ground truth data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We systematically perform a group of experiments for in-season mapping of five major crop types (corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and soybeans-wheat double cropping) over the Mississippi Delta region. The result indicates that the crop cover map of the study area is expected to reach 80\\\\%–90\\\\% agreement with CDL within the growing season. To further facilitate the use of the framework, we also develop a GEE-enabled online prototype, In-season Crop Mapping Kit, and explore its scalability over agricultural fields in various ecoregions including California, Idaho, Kansas, and Illinois. SIGNIFICANCE The mapping-without-ground-truth approach described in this paper can significantly reduce ground truthing process and save substantial resource needs and labor costs, which is applicable to the production of in-season CDL-like data for the entire United States. The findings and outputs will benefit the agriculture community and other agricultural sectors ranging from government, academia, and companies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Contemporary Artificial Intelligence technologies allow for the employment of Computer Vision to discern good crops from bad, providing a step in the pipeline of selecting healthy fruit from undesirable fruit, such as those which are mouldy or damaged. State-of-the-art works in the field report high accuracy results on small datasets ({\\\\textless}1000 images), which are not representative of the population regarding real-world usage. The goals of this study are to further enable real-world usage by improving generalisation with data augmentation as well as to reduce overfitting and energy usage through model pruning. In this work, we suggest a machine learning pipeline that combines the ideas of fine-tuning, transfer learning, and generative model-based training data augmentation towards improving fruit quality image classification. A linear network topology search is performed to tune a VGG16 lemon quality classification model using a publicly-available dataset of 2690 images. We find that appending a 4096 neuron fully connected layer to the convolutional layers leads to an image classification accuracy of 83.77\\\\%. We then train a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network on the training data for 2000 epochs, and it learns to generate relatively realistic images. Grad-CAM analysis of the model trained on real photographs shows that the synthetic images can exhibit classifiable characteristics such as shape, mould, and gangrene. A higher image classification accuracy of 88.75\\\\% is then attained by augmenting the training with synthetic images, arguing that Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks have the ability to produce new data to alleviate issues of data scarcity. Finally, model pruning is performed via polynomial decay, where we find that the Conditional GAN-augmented classification network can retain 81.16\\\\% classification accuracy when compressed to 50\\\\% of its original size.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Intelligent farm robots empowered by proper vision algorithms are the new agricultural machinery that eases weed control with speed and accuracy. Based on the farmland substantial similarity between the crops, and weeds, or other background interference objects, an improved deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) algorithms is proposed for the pixel semantic segmentation of crop and weed. First, a lightweight backbone is proposed to balance the features map textual and shape signals, which are essential cues for better crop and weed prediction. Second, a multi-level feature re-weighted fusion (MFRWF) module is suggested to combine only the relevant information from every backbone layer output to improve the contextual maps of crops and weeds. Finally, a decoder is designed based on convolutional weighted fusion (CWF) to preserve the relevant crop and weed context information by reducing the possible feature context distortion. Experimental results show that our improved neural network obtained the mean intersection of union (MIOU) scores of 0.8646, 0.9164, and 0.8459 on the carrot/weed field image (CWFID), sugar beet (BoniRob), and Rice seedling datasets, respectively. Therefore, the results have not only outperformed the commonly used architectures but can precisely identify crops/weeds and substantially improve the robot inference speed with minimal memory overhead.

       "  'abstract': \"This research work involves data access and control of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) which is designed for health monitoring of paddy crops as an exception from traditional monitoring system. The proposed scheme of autonomous navigation of drones is planned to be carried out as per the six milestones for disease detection and control in paddy crops. Drones serve as Unmanned Robotic Vehicles (URV) capable of performing desired tasks in unstructured, uncertain and potentially hostile environments and are remotely-operated without human intervention. URVs function completely as autonomous entities in diversified environments. Current UGVs adhere to different levels of automaticity. Typically the vehicle follows high level waypoints spaced for few hundred meters of distance to provide monitoring of agricultural fields and early detection of the various diseases that may occur in the paddy fields in a polyhouse. To increase the vehicle's abilities, tracking efficiency, obstacle avoidance, path planning or lead and follow up augmented control with Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is incorporated. The distributed autonomous system for information gathering related to the paddy crops in polyhouse is enabled using different sensors, which is a data-intensive task. To increase the robustness of the system, fuzzy controllers are proposed to control the navigation of the proposed UGV in “All terrain conditions”. They are needed to offer problem specific heuristic control knowledge for the Inference Engine Design which occurs due to imprecision and uncertainty of the sensor readings. It also requires low computation time which favours the polyhouse situations. The navigation of UGV and the FLC action will in turn depend on “All terrain traversability” and “dead zone” monitoring. The proposed UGV model is capable of measuring the parameters associated with the paddy crops inside a polyhouse. The various diseases in paddy crops are False Smut (FS), Sheath Blight (SB), Rice Blast (RB), Leaf Scald (LS), Brown Spot (BS), Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) and Bakane (BE) which are detected using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\",\n",

In the agricultural field, farmers can control the spreading of leaf disease with the help of the modeling of automated disease classification. In comparison to the manual approach to paddy leaf infection detection via visual examination, automated identification of rice illnesses using an image of the paddy leaf may be advantageous. Deep learning, a highly well-liked and effective machine learning method, has recently demonstrated considerable promise in the categorization task of images. In this work, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) pre-processes the augmented images of paddy leaves. The Gray level co-occurrence metrics (GLCM) model then extracts the features from an image of the pre-processed paddy leaves. The five disease classes of paddy leaves were finally identified using the hybrid CNN model as follows: Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB), Sheath Rot (SR), Narrow Brown Leaf Spot (NBLS), Brown Spot (BS) and Leaf Smut (LS).

The right place is determined not only by the geographic location and climate peculiarities but the type of soil as well. Soil is the mainstay of agriculture and horticulture, forming the medium in which growth and ultimately the yield of food-producing crops occur. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a high-performance computing method to create new opportunities to unravel, quantify, and understand data-intensive processes in agricultural operational environments. ML is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The goal of ML is to understand the structure of data and fit it into models so that it can be utilized by people. In this research work, we developed a prediction system for crop selection based on soil features (physical properties, chemical properties, and biological properties) with 28 total properties. Five different hypothetical dataset versions were developed as training data for machine learning algorithms. This system follows analytics maturity curve stages, that is, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive. The system works in two parts. First, it selects the suitable crop for specific soil health. Next, the system recommends health improvement guidelines for the selected soil sample so that the most suitable crop may become more profitable. The research deals with decision tree, naïve Bayes, and random forest algorithms and helps in decision making for crop selection by predicting with the highest accuracy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Scientific studies on species identification in fish have considerable significance in aquatic ecosystems and quality evaluation. The morphological differences between different fish species are obvious. Machine learning methods use artificial prior knowledge to extract fish features, which is time-consuming, laborious, and subjective. Recently, deep learning-based identification of fish species has been widely used. However, fish species identification still faces many challenges due to the small scale of fish samples and the imbalance of the number of categories. For example, the model is prone to being overfitted, and the performance of the classifier is biased to the fish species of most samples. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a fish species identification approach based on SE-ResNet152 and class-balanced focal loss. First, visualization analysis and image preprocessing of fish datasets are carried out. Second, the SE-ResNet152 model is constructed as a generalized feature extractor and is migrated to the target dataset. Finally, we apply the class-balanced focal loss function to train the SE-ResNet152 model, and realize fish species identification on three fish image views (body, head, and scale). The proposed method was tested on the Fish-Pak public dataset and achieved 98.80\\\\%, 96.67\\\\%, and 91.25\\\\% accuracy on the three fish image views, respectively. To ensure the superior performance of the proposed method, we performed an experimental comparison with other methods involving SENet154, DenseNet121, ResNet18, ResNet152, VGG16, cross-entropy, and focal loss. Comprehensive empirical analyses reveal that the proposed method achieves good performance on the three fish image views and outperforms common methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In aquaculture, tracking fish helps to obtain information about their growth, behavior, location and health, etc. However, there are some problems in the process of fish tracking. Firstly, to solve the noise problem of underwater images, we use the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) to carry out local histogram equalization in each small block, which increases the image contrast while retaining more details. This operation enhances the contrast of the image while suppressing noise to solve the problem of noisy images. Then, to solve the problems of similarity interference, occlusion and scale variation among fish, we propose a new method for fish single object tracking in aquaculture environments, called SiamFCA, by combining the coordinated attention mechanism (CA). The method is based on the siamese network framework and uses a modified AlexNet to extract the depth features of image pairs. And through the coordinate attention mechanism, the model can learn the relationship between different objects more accurately, which can improve the accuracy and robustness of the model when dealing with complex image scenes. Finally, the correlation operation between classification and regression is performed based on the region proposal network (RPN). By classifying, region suggestions can be labeled as positive or negative samples, and regression can calibrate the position and size of the region proposal to match targets more accurately. The experimental results show that the precision and success rate of the algorithm are 84.2 \\\\% and 62.4 \\\\%, respectively, which are better than the tracking methods such as SiamRPN and DaSiamRPN, etc. The SiamFCA runs at 83 fps, which meets the demand of real-time fish tracking in aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Purpose: A deep learning-based intelligent system has been developed for the identification and detection of high-density small target pests with the aim of addressing the limitations observed in previous detection systems and manual sorting. The novel system promises to overcome issues of low detection accuracy, low detection efficiency, and serious leakage and error detection. It is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of pest detection, thereby offering a potential solution to the challenges posed by the presence of these pests in agricultural settings. Methods: In this paper, we propose an enhanced YOLOv5s model to tackle challenges in pest detection, such as small targets, high densities, and species diversity. Our method embeds Channel Attention (CA) modules into the algorithm and broadens the shallow feature detection scale of the original FPNet, bolstering small-target detection. Network convergence is accelerated using the Kmeans++ algorithm for prior frame generation and YOLOv5s’ intrinsic weights for transfer learning. The Efficient Intersection over Union (EIOU) loss function is adopted to address unbalanced data labels. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm to determine pest infestation levels, transforming detection results into pest grade evaluations. These advancements form the core of our proposed intelligent pest identification and detection system. Results: In our enhanced YOLOv5s model, we assessed the system’s performance using a dataset comprising six prevalent pest species. This dataset was specifically curated to emulate real-life detection scenarios, featuring small pest targets with similar appearances and imbalanced data labels. We compared our model with a common one-stage model and noted average improvements of 5.5\\\\%, 2\\\\%, and 3.95\\\\% in accuracy, recall, and detection precision respectively across both sparse and dense scenarios. Importantly, the enhanced model maintained a detection time of roughly 10ms per image and was only 1MB larger than the original model, illustrating a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, our algorithm enables the assessment of pest grades based on the input detection results, illustrating the degree of pest infestation. Conclusion: The present paper describes the development of an intelligent system for the automatic identification and detection of pests. Experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency and efficacy of the proposed system in identifying and detecting common pests, even in complex scenarios characterized by high pest density and data label imbalance. Notably, the proposed system has the potential to assist practitioners in the fields of agriculture and forestry to make informed decisions on pest control, thereby improving work efficiency and productivity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tomato diseases have a crucial impact on tomato yield and quality, and their detection and control can improve agricultural production efficiency and promote the healthy development of agricultural production. In this study, diseased tomato leaves were used as the research object and fine-grained feature learning of diseases was performed using a deep-learning method to achieve tomato disease degree detection. The proposed model uses ResNet-50 as the backbone network, and the object positioning, destruction and reassembly, and attention area division modules are built on it. Without adding parameters or further boundary annotation, the object positioning module could reliably predict the location of lesions. By erasing the contextual semantic data, the proposed destruction and reassembly module learns more granular features. The attention area division module is capable of localizing the lesion positions, thereby enhancing the recognition accuracy. The results of the study indicate that the proposed model performed better than state-of-the-art methods in identifying the extent of tomato diseases, and achieved an accuracy of 95.03\\\\%. The accuracy in identifying the types of tomato diseases is 98.25\\\\%. Concludingly, the proposed model is competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches for identifying the severity of tomato diseases and provides a novel model for identifying the degrees of plant diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The approach for estimating biomass in non-contact, free-swimming fish has encountered difficulties such as fish body occlusion, bending, non-orthogonal angles, and low efficiency. To address these issues, this study had combined fish posture recognition (using deep learning technology) with biomass estimation (utilizing stereo vision technology) for the first time, and developed a fast, precise, and fully automatic fish biomass estimation system. The improved single-stage target detection algorithm significantly improved the direct detection and extraction of high-quality images of moving fish in real-time, eliminating the need for manual processing of images that may have imperfect posture. Fish body length and height were measured in the real world using binocular stereo vision technology. Finally, the fish body weight can be estimated by considering the relationship among their body length, height, and weight. The experiment confirmed that the system had successfully avoided influencing factors that could affect fully automatic estimation. The results demonstrated a strong linear relationship between the estimated and measured fish body weights, with a mean relative error (MRE) of 2.87\\\\%. There were no significant differences between the estimated and measured weights (p = 0.94). The MRE of the multi-factor model was much lower than that of the single-factor model (length-weight of 8.86\\\\% and height-weight of 7.41\\\\%). The results indicate that the system developed is a highly effective approach to fully automated biomass estimation. This can be used to guide actual production and further study of the mechanism of fish growth.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Mango production is a prominent tropical fruit industry worldwide. However, outdoor mango cultivation is susceptible to crop damage caused by insect pests and harsh environmental conditions. Integrated pest management (IPM) has emerged as a proposed solution to this problem. IPM utilizes data-driven and environmentally-friendly methods to suppress insect pest populations. Nevertheless, the collection of insect pest population data remains a laborious process, necessitating automation. This paper presents an image-based monitoring system to automatically record insect pest populations and environmental conditions in mango orchards. The system comprises solar-powered sensor nodes capable of periodically acquiring and analyzing sticky paper trap images. A modular deep learning-based algorithm was developed to detect and classify insect pests into seven classes, including major insect pests of mango such as thrips, mango leafhopper, and oriental fruit fly, with an average classification F1-score of 0.96. Unlike other insect counting algorithms, the algorithm reliably classifies insect pests according to different taxonomic levels even in non-laboratory environments. The monitoring system was tested and deployed in a remote mango orchard for over two years. The collected spatiotemporal information was analyzed to demonstrate the benefits of using the proposed system and recommend new IPM strategies. Temporal data analysis revealed a significant decrease in the count of selected insect pests after using the system, enabling identification of insect hotspots through statistical methods. This work presents a breakthrough in hardware and software solutions for developing smarter insect pest monitoring systems, leading to better IPM strategies.',\n",

Fish tracking technology plays an important role in behavior monitoring. It can pay attention to the movement of fish at any time and discover various abnormal behaviors in time.

Its tracking principle is to establish the relationship between fish positions in a continuous video sequence and get the complete movement trajectory of the fish. Nevertheless, computer vision modeling used for fish tracking is riddled with many challenges, such as fish deformation, frequent occlusion, scale change, etc. Around these difficult issues, many scholars have carried out the research.

Further, a detailed discussion of fish tracking methods employing deep learning such as tracking-by-detection, deep features combined with correlation filtering methods, Siamese networks, etc. Furthermore, we summarize datasets that can be used as fish tracking and give evaluation metrics in target tracking algorithms. In addition, experimental data of several mainstream tracking algorithms on a public tracking dataset are given.

       "  'abstract': 'Efficiently and accurately extracting crop plants from authentic and complex field images is essential to ensure the economic efficiency of agricultural production and enhance farming operations. However, many existing deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) prioritize accuracy over efficiency in crop detection, often lacking real-time capabilities. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the automated detection of various crops, such as cotton plants and seed melons, in natural environments using a U-Net established with a Double-depth convolutional and Fusion block (DFU-Net). This involves exploring compound loss functions for improved accuracy. The DFU-Net model combines the strengths of lightweight CNNs and the U-Net model, constructing a Lightweight Crop with a Double-Depth Convolution backbone (LC-DDC). This is achieved by introducing a Double-Depth Convolutional block (DDC block) and incorporating initial and fusion blocks at the first and last positions of the encoder, respectively. The effectiveness of these designs is confirmed through ablation experiments and interpretability analyses. The experimental results indicate that the DFU-Net model achieved Pixel Accuracy (PA), mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and F1 metrics exceeding 92.0 \\\\% for the cotton plant, seed melon, and Chloroplast Viability Prediction in Plant Phenotyping (CVPPP) dataset. Particularly, on the CVPPP dataset, DFU-Net outperformed the Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet) model, demonstrating 16.4 \\\\%, 17.2 \\\\%, and 13.2 \\\\% higher PA, mIoU, and F1 scores, respectively. In addition, DFU-Net demonstrated efficient model space utilization, requiring only 0.975 MB and 1.68 GB for parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs), respectively. The performance of low-performance computers is impressive, achieving a detection speed of 10.5 Frames Per Second (FPS), which is 6.9 times faster than that of the Deeplabv3 + model. This achievement demonstrates a balanced compromise between detection speed and accuracy. This study provides novel approaches for optimizing crop-detection algorithms, providing valuable technical support for intelligent crop management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In order to increase feed utilization and reduce rearing costs, it is crucial to accurately detect remaining pellets in real-time and optimize feeding mechanisms for precise feeding in intensive aquaculture. Machine vision and acoustic methods, which are widely used for the detection of residual particles, fail to adequately address scenarios such as the detection of overlapping, conjoined, faraway and dense particles, as well as particles with interference from water surface ripples and fish motion. To address these issues, this paper proposed a model for uneaten feed detection based on You Only Look Once (YOLO)-v5 network, which was built as follows: (1) The last C3 module of the backbone network is introduced into the coordinated attention (CA) mechanism, which evolves into a coordinated feature attention extraction (CFAE) module to obtain global information. (2) The GSConv module, and the VoVGSCSP module which was the aggregative mode of GSConv module, were adopted in the neck network part. (3) The shallow feature map was spliced with the deep feature map, and the tiny target detection layer (DL) was added for detection. The model elucidates the true condition of the detected residual particles by enhancing detection accuracy and minimizing model complexity, enabling precise and rapid identification of the pellet. This article employs seven sets of data to conduct a comparative analysis of the outcomes achieved before and after enhancing the three major components of the network. The experimental results showed that the YOLOv5s-CAGSDL model achieved an accuracy of 94.1\\\\% for feed particles detection, effectively solving the above problems in the actual rearing environment. Meanwhile, compared with the YOLOv5s model, AP50and FPS of the YOLOv5s-CAGSDL model were increased by 6.30\\\\% and 10.80\\\\% respectively, bringing potential environmental and economic benefits in the actual aquaculture environment.

Deep learning shows excellent performance in crack image detection. However, it is difficult to realize supervised learning due to the lack of labelled underwater crack image datasets. Thus, a transfer learning method named MA-AttUNet is proposed. The proposed method realizes knowledge transfer of crack image features using a multi-level adversarial transfer network. With this method, prior knowledge learned from the source domain can be applied to underwater crack image segmentation. Additionally, the attention mechanism is integrated into the segmentation network to eliminate noise interference during detection by assigning different weights to target and background pixels.

       "  'abstract': 'Sheep farming is a strategic sector of livestock husbandry, and its production has large market demand in many countries. The live weight of sheep provides important information about the health state and the time point for marketing. Manual weighing sheep is time-consuming for farmers even with the help of a ground scale. With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart sensors, non-contact sheep weighing methods have gradually been used to estimate weight. However, the performance of prior studies tends to degenerate with varying postures and light conditions in practical natural environments. In this study, we propose a sheep live weight estimation approach based on LiteHRNet (a Lightweight High-Resolution Network) using RGB-D images. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) guided the design of efficient network heads embracing visual explanation and applicability in practical natural environments. Experiments are conducted on our challenging dataset (of 726 sheep RGB-D images, weight range between 19.5 to 94 kg). Comparative experiment results reveal that the lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on RGB-D images can reach an acceptable weight estimation result, Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) is 14.605\\\\% (95\\\\% confidence interval: [13.821\\\\%, 15.390\\\\%], t test) with only 1.06M parameters. Our works can be viewed as preliminary work that confirms the ability to use lightweight CNNs for sheep weight estimation on RGB-D data. The results of this study are potential to develop an embedded device to automatically estimate sheep live weight and would contribute to the development of precision livestock farming.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart agriculture aims at generating high harvest yields with an efficient resource management, such as the estimation of crop irrigation. One of the factors on which a productive crop irrigation depends on is evapotranspiration, defined as the water loss process from the soil. This is mainly measured by empirical equations, even though they are conditioned by the specific climatological variables they require. In recent years, data mining techniques are proposed as a powerful alternative to predict evapotranspiration. Among them, ensembles are notable in that they provide accurate estimators in different scenarios. Stacking is an ensemble-building technique aimed at strengthening the prediction capabilities of the system by the combined learning from the original features in the data and synthetic features created from the predictions of multiple models. This research proposes the usage of stacking for evapotranspiration prediction, which has been overlooked in the specialized literature, with the aim of a more sustainable management of water resources. The proposal is compared to other state-of-the-art empirical equations and data mining methods over several real-world climatological datasets of different agricultural areas in Spain. This comparison is performed considering separate datasets with features based on temperature, mass transfer, radiation and, finally, using the main meteorological variables together. The results obtained show that stacking is the best approach in all datasets and each group of features evaluated, running as good alternative to predict evapotranspiration when using data of a different nature and under different conditions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Deep-learning-based object detection has brought great convenience to modern intelligent aquaculture. However, its good performance mainly depends on a huge number of labeled training data and the assumption that samples are independent and identically distributed. But in real intensive aquaculture, the acquisition of labeled samples in detection tasks is very time-consuming and laborious. At the same time, due to the influence of light, density, and background complexity, the domain shift caused by different data distribution is inevitable. To solve these problems, we introduce the domain adaptive object detection into aquaculture field for the first time to improve the cross-domain robustness of fish detection. To this end, the interpolation-based unsupervised adversarial domain adaptive fish detection model is proposed in this paper. The proposed model combines the detection network Faster RCNN and three adaptive modules to realize the cross-domain detection of fish. First, the style generation network is used to generate interpolation samples to fill the large distribution gap between the two aquaculture scenes. Then the alignment of local and global features is realized through different levels of adversarial training. Moreover, the focal loss is applied to the global adversarial loss to achieve better global feature alignment. This strategy increases the weight of hard-to-classify samples and enables the feature extraction network to extract more domain-invariant features. We conducted cross-domain adaptation experiments by collecting images from different aquaculture scenes. Compared with the original Faster RCNN and domain adaptation model DA-Faster, the proposed method can not only save the cost of manual annotation, but also effectively improve the detection performance of unlabeled target domain by leveraging the knowledge of the source domain.',\n",

In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three different plant disease datatsets with five plants and 17 plant diseases.

       "  'abstract': 'The quantification of fish feeding activity is a prerequisite for precise feeding. Deep learning has achieved notable achievements in the analysis of fish feeding activity. However, existing deep learning methods for analysing fish feeding activity still have some limitations: 1) they are all strongly supervised methods, and require labels to guide learning; 2) they can only qualitatively evaluate the feeding stage, while continuous quantification is not attained. To address these issues, an appearance-motion autoencoder network (AMA-Net) for quantifying fish feeding activity is proposed. Speciﬁcally, to avoid the tedious and time-consuming manual labelling, semi-supervised learning is adopted in the network. In the learning phase, only non-feeding samples that do not require labelling are used as training data. During the application phase, the continuous quantification of fish feeding activity is realised through the hypothesis of reconstruction error. Moreover, for higher accuracy and stability in fish feeding activity measurement, the proposed network performs modelling from both appearance and motion with the dual-stream framework to accurately quantify fish feeding activity. The experiments qualitatively and quantitatively analysed the performance of AMA-Net, which confirmed the effectiveness, accuracy and stability of AMA-Net in quantifying fish feeding activity. Further, to realise feed fish on demand, an intelligent feeding decision system is proposed, which can automatically determine whether the fish has completed feeding. The experimental results showed that the feeding decision system accurately and effectively decided the endpoints of the feeding process and provided theoretical support for production practices in aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rice is a crucial agricultural crop, yet it frequently suffers from various diseases, leading to decreased yields and, in severe cases, crop failure. Diseases significantly affect rice growth and yield, resulting in economic losses and food security challenges. The role of image recognition in identifying rice diseases is critical in agricultural production. It enables automated and efficient detection of rice diseases, which is essential for effective management, ensuring food security and sustainable agriculture. To address issues like background noise and edge blurring in rice disease image capture, as well as challenges in determining the optimal learning rate during the training of traditional rice disease recognition networks, a novel method based on PSOC-DRCNet is proposed for rice disease recognition.. First, tto solve the problem of background interference, Dual Mode Attention (DMA) is proposed to adaptively capture meaningful regions in rice disease images. Second, the Residual Adaptive Block(RAB) is proposed, which utilizes dimensional changes and channel attention to solve edge blur problems. Then, a Cross entropy and regularized mixed Loss function (CerLoss), is proposed to optimize the learning strategy of the model in the process of processing datasets and enhance the performance and generalization ability of the model to avoid overfitting problems. Ultimately, In response to the cumbersome problem of finding the optimal learning rate, we propose using Particle Swarm Optimization Chameleon (PSOC) to find the optimal learning rate and train the PSOC-DRCNet model on our custom dataset and compare it with other existing methods and the final average classification accuracy of PSOC-DRCNet is 93.88\\\\% with an F1 score of 0.940. We compare it with other existing methods. It is proved that the average classification accuracy of our model under hyper-parameter unification is 92.65\\\\% F1 score is 0.928. We validated the PSOC-DRCNet by conducting comparative analyses with other models and through generalization experiments and module effectiveness tests. Additionally, the practicality of PSOC-DRCNet was confirmed through its application in real-world scenarios. The methods proposed in this paper successfully enable the identification of various diseases in rice leaves, offering a practical solution for incorporating deep learning into the agricultural production process. Furthermore, these findings serve as a valuable reference for disease identification in other crops.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'India is among the biggest tea exporter in the world. However, tea leaf diseases caused by persistent pathogen exposure result in considerable crop yield losses around the world. Detection of the disease of tea leaves at early stages can reduce the damage of tea output. Detecting the disease with the naked eye can be inefficient and counterproductive. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used to implement an effective method for the image classification. In detection of plant disease, the use of CNN is widespread. Therefore, in the proposed work, a Deep CNN having multiple hidden layers is considered for the classification of diseased tea leaves into different categories. This helps the network in detecting more number of features and thereby improving the accuracy in disease detection. The classification is done consisting of the following categories of leaves; Gray Blight, Algal Spot, Brown Blight, Helopeltis, Healthy Leaves and Red Spot. Further, a labeled dataset consisting of 5867 diseased and healthy tea leaf images have been created and uploaded on Kaggle. The suggested method demonstrates that the model is able to accurately detect the kind of persistent tea leaf disease with a 96.56\\\\% accuracy. The accuracy of the following disease classes are as follows, Algal Spot has an accuracy of 98.23\\\\%, Brown Blight has an accuracy of 97.98\\\\%, Gray Blight has an accuracy of 93.46\\\\%, Healthy classes of leaves has an accuracy of 99.10\\\\%, the Helopeltis disease class has an accuracy of 98.98\\\\% and Red Spot has an accuracy of 92\\\\% The model that is proposed in this literature is far superior than the existing methods in terms of accuracy. Furthermore this model can be adopted to work with various IoT devices to deploy in real world applications and the architecture of this model can be used to train different crop images to classify their diseases.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rapid and non-destructive classification of seed varieties is one of the important goals pursued by modern seed industry. Due to the large number of maize varieties in practice, collecting training samples that exhaust all varieties to train a classifier is extremely difficult. Therefore, maize seed classification in the real world faces the challenge of variety renewal and rejection of unknown varieties. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable incremental learning (IL) framework based on hypercube data. This method achieves class-IL via learning one-class classifier (OCC) incrementally, and directly uses raw data as input without additional data preprocessing and feature extraction. The OCC is a dual deep support vector data description, which makes full use of spectral and spatial information to establish an exclusive hypersphere for a specific variety to receive the variety and reject unknown varieties. To remove the interference of redundant bands, a band attention and sparse constraint module is added to automatically assign the weights of redundant bands to zero, thereby maximally improving the performance of the model. Moreover, a new loss function is defined to alleviate the difficulty of parameter updating after sparse constraint. Experimental results on our open set indicate that the accuracy of the proposed method for receiving known varieties and rejecting unknown varieties are both above 91 \\\\%, which has significant advantages over the other two state-of-the-art IL methods. In the future, the corresponding OCCs can also be deleted from the whole framework according to the varieties eliminated by the government to reduce computational overhead and inter-class interference. Overall, the proposed method can perform both IL and open set recognition.',\n",

Around the world, more than 80\\\\% of agricultural production is generated by farmers, and over 50\\\\% of their yield is lost due to pests and pathogens, leading to mass disruption in food supply and a large number of hungry people. Identifying a disease correctly is a crucial first step for efficient treatment but remains difficult in many parts of the world due to limited access to agricultural experts and professional infrastructure. The purpose of this research was to create a free, easy-to-use, and widely accessible mobile application that efficiently and accurately, diagnoses 26 diseases of 14 crop species. Furthermore, this application provides treatment steps, common symptoms, and access to recommended curing products for each disease. The real-time crop disease diagnosis is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that was trained, validated, and tested on a dataset of 87,860 leaf images split into 38 classes. To design an optimal CNN, 16 different CNNs were designed and tested. MobileNetV2 using the Canny Edge Detection filter was chosen as it had the highest classification accuracy of 95.7\\\\% and an F1 score of 96.1. Multi-level testing and data analysis was conducted for this application, it has been verified to be functional in the real world through field testing at local garden centers. This application is a novel and accessible tool for crop disease management and can be deployed as a free service to farmers for ecologically sustainable production, overall increasing food security.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent advancements in fish tracking methodologies provide valuable solutions for assessing fish growth, marine fisheries, and biological research. In particular, there has been a burgeoning interest in vision-based methods for fish tracking, owing to the enhanced computational capabilities facilitated by deep learning models. However, these methods face several challenges, including poor fish detection performance under complex backgrounds, the potential for identification switches caused by the non-rigid features and occlusions of fish, and the limited fault tolerance of extant approaches. In this paper, a transformer-based multiple fish tracking model (TFMFT) is proposed, specifically designed to address the issue of instance loss of fish targets in aquaculture ponds with complex background disturbance. In particular, we introduce a Multiple Association (MA) method that bolsters fault tolerance in tracking by synthesizing simple Intersection-over-Union matching in the identification (ID) matching module. Through empirical studies across diverse Transformer-based models, we comprehensively assessed the influence of architecture design on data requirements. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance and generalizability of fish tracking models, we present the Multiple\\\\_Fish\\\\_Tracking\\\\_2022 (MFT22) dataset. The results demonstrate that TFMFT achieves 30.6\\\\% IDF1 (Identification F-Score) on the MFT22 dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 10.9\\\\% and showcasing superior performance over other models.

       "  'abstract': 'Honeybees are the most specialized insect pollinators and are critical not only for honey production but, also, for keeping the environmental balance by pollinating the flowers of a wide variety of crops. Recording and analyzing bee sounds became a fundamental part of recent initiatives in the development of so-called smart hives. The majority of researches on beehive sound analytics are focusing on swarming detection, a relatively simple binary classification task (due to the obvious difference in the sound of a swarming and a non-swarming bee colony) where machine learning models achieve good performance even when trained on small data. However, in the case of more complex tasks of beehive sound analytics, even modern machine learning approaches perform poorly. First, training such models would need a large dataset but, according to our knowledge, there is no publicly available large-scale beehive audio data. Second, due to the specifics of beehive sounds, efficient noise filtering methods would be required, however, we could not find a noise filtering method that would increase the performance of machine learning models substantially. In this paper, we propose a dynamic noise filtering method applicable on spectrograms (image representations of audio data) which is superior to the most popular image noise filtering baselines. Further, we introduce a multi-class classification task of bee sounds and a large-scale dataset consisting of 10.000 beehive audio recordings. Finally, we provide the results of a large-scale experiment involving various combinations of audio feature extraction and noise filtering methods together with various deep learning models. We believe that the contributions of this paper will facilitate further research in the area of (beehive) sound analytics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In intensive aquaculture, quantitative research on bait particles has important theoretical and practical significance for reducing breeding costs and realizing intelligent feeding, and can effectively reduce environmental pollution caused by excessive bait. However, the current methods based on acoustics and machine vision are difficult to count tiny or overlapped bait particles, resulting in low counting accuracy of model. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a counting model for small bait particles, using MCNN as the basic network to achieve efficient and stable counting performance in aquaculture. The proposed model consists of two parts: a multi-column feature extractor and a density map generator. The multi-column feature extractor is used as the front-end network of model. By introducing multiple branches, convolution kernels with different size are used to extract feature information of different scales and adapt to the non-uniform bait particles. Thereby, the multi-scale problem caused by perspective variation of bait particles is solved. In addition, the density map generator is used as the back-end network of model. Instead of the 1 × 1 convolutional layer in the original MCNN, the density map generator takes advantage of transposed convolutional layer to restore the poor quality of the density map caused by the down-sample in the multi-column feature extraction network. Besides, the ReLU function is helpful to increase the fitting ability of the model. Moreover, in order to further improve the quality of the density map and the counting performance of the model, the Euclidean distance loss and the structural similarity loss are combined as the final loss function of the model. The fusion of loss is beneficial to solve the ambiguity of density map caused by the Euclidean loss function. As the experimental results showed, compared with the original MCNN network, the mean absolute error MAE of the proposed model is reduced by 69.35\\\\%, and the mean square error MSE is reduced by 70.87\\\\%. In summary, the proposed bait particles counting model has high counting accuracy and is more stable, it is in favor of providing theoretical support for intelligent feeding study in aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Machine learning and sensor devices lined up with agriculture for the development of systems can efficiently provide real-time knowledge on animal behavior without the need of intense human observation, which is time consuming and labor demanding. In this study, we propose an intelligent system to classify the three important activities of sheep namely, “grazing”, “active”, and “inactive” states. We acquire primary data from Hebridean ewes using two types of sensors to capture the required activities. To address the problem of sensor heterogeneity in data and sensor orientation placement, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) in conjunction with hand-crafted features, to improve the model generalization, specifically in terms of sensor orientation and position. Additionally, we utilise transfer learning (TL) for the model generalisation, which indicates substantial potential in future studies concerning animal activity recognition. More specifically, we use the TL to enable the reusability of pre-trained model for purely unseen data without performing model training and data labelling, which are highly time-consuming tasks. We performed experiments on datasets using CNN with automatic learned features, and on datasets using additional hand-crafted features. Our method obtained an overall accuracy of 98.55\\\\% on the source data (i.e., dataset captured via first sensor), and 96.59\\\\% on the target data (i.e., dataset captured via second sensor) when using the datasets which comprised the supplementary features. On the other hand, when CNN was applied to the raw datasets without any additional features, an accuracy of 97.46\\\\% and 94.79\\\\% was obtained on the source and target dataset respectively. This study is the first of its kind to propose convolutional neural network-based TL for the sheep activity recognition and demonstrate the significance of proposed approach in the context of data capturing, data labelling, and heterogeneity of sensor devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Feeding is an important link in aquaculture that not only affects the healthy growth of fish but is also the main factor that determines the cost and economic benefits of aquaculture. At present, feeding in aquaculture is mainly based on mechanical timing and quantity, relying on a fixed amount of feed preset by the breeder, which does not take into account the dynamic feeding needs of the fish. Problems of underfeeding or overfeeding may occur, affecting the growth rate of the fish and polluting the aquaculture water. Machine vision is an efficient, economical, non-destructive, and objective detection and analysis technology, which is of great significance in promoting the automation and intelligence of aquaculture. Therefore, the combination of machine vision and fish feeding demand for feeding is helpful to improve efficiency and achieve intelligent aquaculture. This paper reviews the research on intelligent fish feeding based on machine vision. The main factors affecting feeding are introduced, followed by a general description of the process of intelligent fish feeding based on machine vision, and a detailed overview and analysis of the key technologies involved in image acquisition, image processing and analysis, and intelligent fish feeding. It also discusses the challenges and potential solutions in intelligent feeding. In short, it aims to help researchers and industry practitioners to better understand the state of the art of machine vision in intelligent fish feeding, and to assist in promoting accurate feeding and improving the efficiency of aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Crop counting plays different roles in different growth stages. The counting of the early stage is used to evaluate seed germination rate and seedling survival rate, the counting during growth is used to evaluate plant mortality caused by potential pests and diseasesand, and the counting of the later stage is used to accurately evaluate crop yield. Therefore, how to realize the automatic, fast, and accurate counting of crops during the whole growth period is a key problem to be solved urgently. The development of computer vision and artificial intelligence technology has laid good technical support for crop counting. According to the growth characteristics and cultivation process of lettuce, combined with the requirements of model generalization performance, this study collected image datasets of 9 growth stages of multiple varieties of lettuce. Then, according to the specific requirements of model deployment in the actual production scenario, taking YOLOv5s as the benchmark model, a variety of lightweight strategies are used to improve it, to find the best balance between model performance, size, and inference speed. Finally, this study proposes a lightweight YOLOv5s lettuce counting model based on ShuffleNetv2. The mAP of the model is 99.42\\\\%, Recall is 99.13\\\\%, Precision is 98.24\\\\%, F1-score is 0.99, the model-size is only 3.18 M, and the inference time is only 1.0 ms.

       "  'abstract': \"Primary crop losses in agriculture are due to leaf diseases, which farmers cannot identify early. If the diseases are not detected early and correctly, then the farmer will have to undergo huge losses. Therefore, in the field of agriculture, the detection of leaf diseases in tomato crops plays a vital role. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning techniques have made disease prediction easy in agriculture. Tomato crop front side leaf images are considered for research due to their high exposure to diseases. The image segmentation process assumes a significant role in identifying disease affected areas on tomato leaf images. Therefore, this paper develops an efficient tomato crop leaf disease segmentation model using an enhanced radial basis function neural network (ERBFNN). The proposed ERBFNN is enhanced using the modified sunflower optimization (MSFO) algorithm. Initially, the noise present in the images is removed by a Gaussian filter followed by CLAHE (contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization) based on contrast enhancement and un-sharp masking. Then, color features are extracted from each leaf image and given to the segmentation stage to segment the disease portion of the input image. The performance of the proposed ERBFNN approach is estimated using different metrics such as accuracy, Jaccard coefficient (JC), Dice's coefficient (DC), precision, recall, F-Measure, sensitivity, specificity, and mean intersection over union (MIoU) and are compared with existing state-of-the-art methods of radial basis function (RBF), fuzzy c-means (FCM), and region growing (RG). The experimental results show that the proposed ERBFNN segmentation model outperformed with an accuracy of 98.92\\\\% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods like RBFNN, FCM, and RG, as well as previous research work.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Soluble solids content (SSC) is one of the most important internal quality attributes of fruit and could be predicted using near-infrared (NIR) spectra and optical properties. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is a conventional regression method in SSC prediction. In recent years, deep learning methods represented by convolutional neural network (CNN) was suggested to be implied in spectral analysis. However, researchers are inevitably facing problems with regard to the selection of spectral pretreatment methods and the evaluation of the performance of the chosen regression. This study employed PLSR and CNN regression to predict SSC of apple based on the collected diffuse reflectance spectra of intact apple, total reflectance and total transmittance spectra of apple pulp, and the calculated optical property spectra, i.e., absorption coefficient and reduced scattering coefficient spectra of apple pulp. Five different spectral pretreatment methods were exerted on these spectra. Results showed that at a given regression (PLSR or CNN), the built models based on the diffuse reflectance spectra of intact apple had the best SSC prediction, and the built models based on pulp’s reduced scattering coefficient spectra had the poorest prediction performance. The best prediction performance was achieved by PLSR models using Savitzky-Golay with multiple scattering correction (Rp = 0.96, RMSEP = 0.54 \\\\%) and CNN regressions using Savitzky-Golay with standard normal variational transformation (Rp = 0.95, RMSEP = 0.59 \\\\%), respectively. Additionally, when the unknown original spectra were used for modeling, CNN had a better performance compared to PLSR, indicating the outstanding preponderance of CNN in spectral analysis. This study provides an effective reference for the selection of chemometric method based on NIR spectra.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Accurate detection of apple diseases is crucial for agricultural production as it enables timely diagnosis and control, thereby reducing crop yield losses. However, detecting apple leaf spots presents significant challenges due to unconstrained environmental conditions and multi-scale variations. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based detection algorithm to accurately detect multi-scale apple leaf spots in unconstrained environments. The proposed method consists of several steps. First, a dataset of apple leaf disease spots with high-quality labels is created under the guidance of agricultural experts. Second, a Bole convolution module (BCM) for reducing the interference of redundant feature information on extracting feature information of apple leaf disease images in unconstrained environments is designed. Third, a cross-attention module (CAM) for reducing the computational effort of the detection network in non-diseased regions to reduce the impact of background interference information on the feature representation capability of the network is proposed. Fourth, to reduce the loss of surface and deep feature information of apple leaf diseases during feature fusion and communication, we employ a bidirectional transposition feature pyramid network (BTFPN) to address this problem. Finally, the proposed apple leaf disease detection network, which combines the Bole convolution module, Cross-attention module, and Bidirectional Transposed feature pyramid Network (BCTNet), achieves an accuracy of 85.23\\\\% and an average detection speed of 33 FPS on the self-built dataset. The proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. From visible light images, it can detect multi-scale disease spots on apple leaf surfaces in natural environments and provide decision information to growers and pesticide spraying robots. The proposed method can replace traditional manual diagnosis methods, optimize the spraying efficiency of pesticide robots, and reduce pesticide waste in non-diseased areas.

       "  'abstract': \"Due to the frequent outbreaks of agricultural pests, agricultural production is limited and crop yield is minimized. Several types of agricultural pests, on the other hand, provide greater obstacles to workers when it comes to recognizing them. Currently, present agricultural pest detection techniques are frequently unable to meet the demands of agricultural production due to model inefficiency. The goal of this paper is to present a pest identification model that detects the Heliothis armigera (Cotton bollworm) and Leptocorisa acuta (rice bug) using four primary phases: i) Pre-processing (ii) Object tracking and Segmentation (iv) Feature extraction and (v) Classification.“ The input video frame (pictures) is first subjected to a pre-processing phase, during which the video frames are pre-processed. Object tracking and segmentation are then applied to the pre-processed pictures. The Fuzzy C-means (FCM) technique is used to segment the foreground and background in this case. The suggested GLCM based texture feature, color, edge, and form based characteristics are derived from the segmented pictures. Furthermore, the collected features are fed into the detection process, which employs hybrid classifiers such as LSTM and RNN. The RNN training is done utilizing the Self Improved Tunicate swarm Algorithm (SITSA) by finding the ideal weights for exact detection outcomes. Finally, the suggested scheme's performance is compared to those of other current schemes using metrics such as FDR, specificity, accuracy, precision, FNR, sensitivity, FPR, Thread score, FMS, FOR, NPV, and MCC.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Pests and insects are the main hazards to crops, and they have a significant negative impact on both human health and wealth. Identification and classification of different types of crop insects accurately is an important task to avoid these losses. A manual examination is a quite sluggish and less efficient way of accomplishing this task while computer vision technology can significantly assist in this issue. A CNN-based deep learning model can classify insects and pests efficiently. In this paper, an ensemble-based model has been proposed using transfer learning. The experimental setup comprises pre-trained models like VGG16, VGG19, and ResNetv50 with a voting classifier ensemble technique. These pre-trained models are used to train the training dataset in a parallel pipeline model which is united with Ensemble Voting Classifier to generate the final prediction over the input sample. The benchmark IP102 dataset, having more than 75000 samples over 102 classes, is used to train and evaluate the model's performance. Results show that the proposed ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 82.5\\\\%, which is significant improvement over the recent state-of-the-art models proposed over the same selected dataset, hence strongly supporting the efficacy of the model.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Traditional postharvest fruit quality control relies on physicochemical indicators, rigid sensors, and complex instruments for monitoring, detection, or prediction. However, this approach has several limitations, such as time-consuming procedures, destructive techniques, and low monitoring accuracy. In this paper, we propose the use of flexible sensing technology as an alternative to rigid sensors in postharvest fruit quality monitoring and long-term environmental signal monitoring. The paper examines fruit quality characterization parameters, analyzes the performance requirements of flexible sensors in various cold chain scenarios, and explores emerging applications of flexible technologies in fruit quality control at internal, external, and environmental levels. The study demonstrates that the exceptional stretchability and biocompatibility of flexible sensors offer promising platforms for real-time fruit quality monitoring and detection. Moreover, the use of multi-scale flexible sensors enables information sensing in confined spaces. Combining these sensors with machine learning algorithms, wireless sensing technology, and intelligent devices like manipulators effectively enhances monitoring accuracy. Finally, the paper discusses future directions for improvement, including advancements in materials and processes, passive sensing methods, and integration with other smart technologies or devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Advances in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and high-performance computing have enabled the creation of efficient solutions to monitor pests and identify plant diseases. In this context, we present InsectCV, a system for automatic insect detection in the lab from scanned trap images. This study considered the use of Moericke-type traps to capture insects in outdoor environments. Each sample can contain hundreds of insects of interest, such as aphids, parasitoids, thrips, and flies. The presence of debris, superimposed objects, and insects in varied poses is also common. To develop this solution, we used a set of 209 grayscale images containing 17,908 labeled insects. We applied the Mask R-CNN method to generate the model and created three web services for the image inference. The model training contemplated transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. This approach defined two new parameters to adjust the ratio of false positive by class, and change the lengths of the anchor side of the Region Proposal Network, improving the accuracy in the detection of small objects. The model validation used a total of 580 images obtained from field exposed traps located at Coxilha, and Passo Fundo, north of Rio Grande do Sul State, during wheat crop season in 2019 and 2020. Compared to manual counting, the coefficients of determination (R2 = 0.81 for aphids and R2 = 0.78 for parasitoids) show a good-fitting model to identify the fluctuation of population levels for these insects, presenting tiny deviations of the growth curve in the initial phases, and in the maintenance of the curve shape. In samples with hundreds of insects and debris that generate more connections or overlaps, model performance was affected due to the increase in false negatives. Comparative tests between InsectCV and manual counting performed by a specialist suggest that the system is sufficiently accurate to guide warning systems for integrated pest management of aphids. We also discussed the implications of adopting this tool and the gaps that require further development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rapid and accurate detection of green peppers are essential for their growth monitoring, yield estimation, phenotypic monitoring, and robotic harvesting. In order to simplify the detection model and improve the detection efficiency, the NSGA-II-based (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II-based) pruning algorithm was proposed to obtain an optimal pruning that balanced the detection accuracy and speed of the pruned model. A green pepper detection model was trained using YOLOv5l, and the NSGA-II-based pruning algorithm was implemented to obtain a YOLOv5l pepper detection model. The number of model parameters, model size, and GFlops of the pruned model were reduced by 73.9 \\\\%, 73.5 \\\\%, and 62.7 \\\\%, respectively. The mAP0.5 of the pruned model was 81.4 \\\\%, only slightly lower (by 0.973 \\\\%) than that of the original model.The detection speed of the pruned model was 70.9f/s, which was 59.0 \\\\% higher than that of the model before pruning. The NSGA-II-based pruning also significantly outperformed other two algorithms, namely, Slim pruning and EagleEye pruning, in terms of number of parameters, model size, GFlops, and detection speed, with a slight reduction in mAP0.5 0.973 \\\\% compared to EagleEye pruning. Finally, the NSGA-II-based pruned YOLOv5l pepper detection model was compared with other 11 deep learning models. Except that the mAP0.5 was only 0.367 \\\\% lower than that of YOLOv4, our method again showed had obvious advantages in terms of parameter quantity, model size, GFlops, mAP0.5, and detection speed. This research provided a new method and insights for the pruning of deep learning models, which is a necessary step to deploy them in compact mobile devices for real-time applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Automatic fruit counting is an important task for growers to estimate yield and manage orchards. Although many deep-learning-based fruit detection algorithms have been developed to improve performance of automatic fruit counting systems, abnormal fruit detection has often been caused by these algorithms detecting non-target fruits that have similar growth characteristics to target fruits. For abnormal fruit detection, detected fruits in the back row of the tree were defined as DFBRT, while detected fruits on the ground were defined as DFG. Both of them would result in a higher number of fruits counting than the ground truth. This study proposes an automatic fruit counting system called NDMFCS (Normal Detection Matched Fruit Counting System) to solve this problem for improving fruit counting accuracy in modern apple orchard. NDMFCS consists of three sub-systems, i.e. object detection based on You Only Look Once Version 4-tiny (YOLOv4-tiny), abatement of abnormal fruit detection based on threshold, and fruit counting based on trunk tracking and identity document (ID) assignment. YOLOv4-tiny was selected to implement detection of fruits and trunks, whose output is confidence and pixel coordinates of detected object. The DFBRT and DFG were abated by thresholds to improve detection performance of fruit. This meant that detected fruits were removed when their distance from camera is further than a distance threshold or the confidence of fruit detection is less than a confidence threshold. Finally, fruit counting was implemented by trunk tracking and ID assignment, where each fruit was assigned a unique tracking ID. Results on 10 sets of original videos indicated that average fruit detection precision was improved from 89.1\\\\% to 93.3\\\\% after abatement of abnormal fruit detection. Also, Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy and Multiple Object Tracking Precision were improved on average by 4.2\\\\% and 3.3\\\\%, respectively, while average ID Switch Rate was decreased on average by 1.1\\\\%. And average fruit counting accuracy was improved to 95.0\\\\% by 4.2\\\\%. Coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.97, which indicated the number of fruits counted by NDMFCS was near to the ground truth. These results demonstrate that the abatement of abnormal fruit detection can improve performance of apple counting, which has the potential to provide a technical support for estimating fruit yield in modern apple orchards.',\n",

However, the adopted IPM strategies involve human operators who manually monitor and evaluate insect pests and their effects, respectively. The manual methods involved are tedious, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. To avoid the drawbacks, monitoring processes can be made automatic, which involves the detection of the flies without human operator intervention. To achieve automatic detection and monitoring, insect traps are equipped with electronic sensors (i.e., optical, acoustic, or image) for accurate and efficient monitoring. The traps are further linked together over a communication network, allowing the pests to be monitored remotely without requiring frequent field visits, which leads to smart traps.

This paper proposes a Siamese attention model (Siam-AM) fusion attention mechanism to obtain the automatic tracking and monitoring of cow legs in large-scale farms. Firstly, the features of the cow’s leg are extracted using the first frame of motion image data. The search area in the subsequent frames is also input into the network to extract additional features. Then an attention module is used to assign weights to the features. The similarity between different regions and image features of the first frame was compared. The image with the most significant similarity was taken as the predicted position of the cow’s leg. Finally, the relative step size of the cow’s front and rear legs is calculated using the leg’s position coordinates. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is constructed to realize the lameness detection of the cow. The experimental results show that the proposed Siam-AM algorithm has an average tracking accuracy of 93.80 \\\\%, an average frame rate of 57 fps, and a lameness detection accuracy of 94.73 \\\\%.

       "  'abstract': 'Deep learning has achieved kiwifruit detection with high accuracy and fast speed. However, all the kiwifruits have been labeled and detected as only one class in most researches for robotic fruit picking, where fruits occluded by branches or wires have been detected as pickable targets. End-effectors or robots may be damaged by the branches or wires when they are forced to pick those fruits. Therefore, kiwifruits are labeled, trained, and detected in multi-classes based on their occlusions to avoid detecting fruits occluded by branches or wires as pickable targets. Fruits are classified into four classes and five classes according to robotic picking strategy and field occlusions, respectively. Well-known YOLOv3 and recently released YOLOv4 are employed to do transfer learning for multi-classes kiwifruit detection. Results show that mAP (mean average precision) of fruits in the five-classes is higher than that in the four-classes, while mAP of YOLOv4 is higher than YOLOv3. The mAP of YOLOv4 and YOLOv3 in the five-classes and four-classes are 91.9\\\\%, 91.5\\\\%, 91.1\\\\%, and 89.5\\\\%, respectively. The results demonstrate that fruits labeled and trained in more classes can achieve higher mAP. There are significant differences in average detection speed in YOLOv3 and YOLOv4, but no in the four-classes and five-classes. Overall, the highest mAP of 91.9\\\\% was achieved by YOLOv4 in the five-classes, which cost 25.5 ms on average to process a 2352 × 1568 image. The results illustrate that multi-classes kiwifruit detection is helpful for avoiding damage to the end-effectors or robots.',\n",

However, with the increase of network depth, the defects of large training memory and poor real-time performance restrict the deployment of the algorithm in aquaculture end devices.

First of all, replacing the YOLOv4 backbone network with the lightweight network MobileNetV3 and replacing the standard convolution with a deep separable convolution have achieved a significant reduction in network parameters and calculations; Secondly, deformable convolution is used to improve the target feature extraction ability and increase the detection accuracy of the model in underwater images; Finally, an ablation experiment is conducted to compare the detection effect under different deformable convolution layers and network positions. Experimental results show that the combination of three-layer deformable convolution and standard convolution has the best performance. Compared with the YOLO series, the proposed model has an accuracy of 95.47\\\\% while the parameter amount is reduced by 10 times and the FPS is doubled.

Fast and accurate detection of kiwifruit flower and bud simultaneously in an orchard is essential for robotic pollination. It not only makes precision pollination possible but also can predict blooming peak to estimate the optimal pollination timing. However, only kiwifruit flower has been labeled and detected in recent studies. Therefore, kiwifruit flower and bud were labeled, trained, and detected simultaneously for robotic pollination. Well-known YOLOv3 and recently released YOLOv4 were applied to do transfer learning for kiwifruit flower and bud detection. Both were trained in the same image dataset and compared by Average Precision (AP) and processing speed, which were aimed to find a better model. Results showed that mean AP (mAP) of YOLOv4 (97.61\\\\%) was higher than YOLOv3 (95.24\\\\%) on kiwifruit flower and bud detection. The AP of flower and bud detection achieved by YOLOv4 were 96.66\\\\% and 98.57\\\\%, respectively, which were 0.17\\\\% and 4.58\\\\% higher than that of YOLOv3.

       "  'abstract': 'Fry counting is an essential task in aquaculture that provides valuable information for feedstuff feeding, culture density adjustment, and fish economic benefit estimation. However, most current computer vision-based fry counting methods are designed for statically counting, with a fixed number of fry in a container. As a result, these methods are not suitable for dynamic scenarios, such as flowing water, where the effects of factors like water velocity and uneven lighting can cause errors in counting. To address this issue and improve accuracy, we propose a dynamic fry counting method capable of dealing with large-number fry counting. Specifically, we regard fry counting as a Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) problem based on Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) framework. Firstly, a dataset of streaming fry is constructed for training the detection model, and videos with varying numbers of fry are manually counted for counting tests. Secondly, due to the highly similar appearance of fry, Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) is combined with You Only Look Once version 5 Nano (YOLOv5-Nano) to perform fry tracking. To achieve stable tracking of fry movement, the SORT algorithm is improved based on multi-matching and trajectory recovery, reaching 82.6 \\\\% multi-object tracking accuracy. Finally, fry counting is realized based on the intersection of a counting line and moving trajectories. The results indicate that the proposed counting method achieves 96.4 \\\\% accuracy and can be implemented on CPU at 5–10 frames per second (fps) and GPU at 15–35 fps. In conclusion, the proposed method automatically counts the number of fry in videos with higher speed and accuracy, facilitating automated fishery farming.',\n",

Most of studies on apple detection identified all target fruits as one class regardless of fruit condition and other canopy objects. However, some detected fruits were physically occluded by branches or trellis wires that could diminish the effectiveness of fruit picking and even damage the end-effector, especially when high-vigor rootstock apple cultivar was used. A multi-class apple detection method in dense-foliage fruiting-wall trees was thus proposed based on Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network. It detected apples in different conditions such as non-occluded, leaf-occluded, branch/wire-occluded, and fruit-occluded fruit. A total of 800 images were acquired and then augmented to 12,800 images. Average precision of non-occluded, leaf-occluded, branch/wire-occluded, and fruit-occluded fruit were 0.909, 0.899, 0.858, and 0.848, respectively. Overall, the mean average precision of the four classes was 0.879, and an average of 0.241 s was needed to process an image. The results indicated that all the apples in different classes could be effectively detected, which can help the robot to decide the picking strategy (e.g., picking order and path planning) as well as to avoid the potential damage by the branches and trellis wires.',\n",

Intelligent information perception ideas for different application scenarios are stimulated with the rapid development of sensors, information communication and robotics technologies and artificial intelligence-based information processing technologies worldwide. Intelligent perception of information in the poultry farming process is important for the liberation of labor, safeguarding animal welfare, and improving the automation and efficiency of poultry farming. In this review, the information perception framework in modern poultry farming has been analyzed to fully illustrate the important role of information perception in modern poultry farming. In addition, we have reviewed the research of information perception technology in poultry farming in 26 countries around the world. According to the different research goals, it is mainly divided into five aspects: individual poultry target perception, behavior recognition, health and environmental monitoring, and breeding-related robots. Some tables are provided to summarize and review research information on different topics. We found that for the information perception in poultry breeding, many challenges still need to be solved, such as the accurate perception of poultry individual information in complex environment, multi-scale monitoring of poultry house environment, intelligent disease diagnosis and exception handling, robot function expansion and multi-robot coordination. To achieve the goal of accurate, efficient, and intelligent perception of information in the unmanned poultry farming system, we have also pointed out the future research focus and development trends respectively by combining the characteristics of different problems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Non-contact methods for estimating cultured fish weight are essential for aquaculture companies to develop aquaculture strategies and management plans. However, it is challenging for current technologies to precisely measure the size of fish in a densely breeding environment and estimate the weight of fish because of issues including occlusion, fish bending and not facing the camera. This study, which focuses on the aforementioned issues, suggests a technique for creating an instance segmentation dataset appropriate for measuring fish size as well as an attention-based fully convolutional instance segmentation network (CAM-Decoupled-SOLO) to extract fish contour features. This study uses a concatenation approach to fuse low-level features and high-level features in order to safeguard low-level features so as to address the issue of low-level feature information loss in the bottom-up propagation process of feature pyramid networks. Additionally, by combining pixel location information with channel attention mechanism, this work achieves the integration of target location information and channel dimension information. To validate the developed methodology, it has been applied to an aquaculture system. The results showed that the mAP of proposed method would be improved by 2.6\\\\% compared with Decoupled-SOLO. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments would be enhanced when compared to the existing well-liked one-stage network. Moreover, to save labor cost and avoid fish damage, an automatic fish perimeter measurement model and a weight prediction system were constructed by combining fish contours extracted by CAM-Decoupled-SOLO and binocular vision. There was a significant correlation between fish perimeter and weight, which can be used to estimate the weight of fish in complex aquaculture environments.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Plant diseases may threaten the safety of crops around the world, and timely detection of crop diseases and accurate determination of disease species are important to protect crop safety and control the spread of diseases. Recent studies have proposed the application of modern automatic recognition systems based on convolutional neural networks to the identification tasks of multiple crops and diseases. Although some research results have been achieved, studies have shown that these models are not optimal because they are susceptible to features unrelated to crop diseases, and have poor application ability in real-world environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a more concise method that separating the crop and disease identification and classify them independently, and demonstrates that it is more effective than the traditional crop-disease pairs approach. Meanwhile, we constructed a trilinear convolutional neural networks model using bilinear pooling and used images obtained in a real-world environment for the study of crop disease identification. The crop and disease identification accuracies achieved 99.99\\\\% and 99.7\\\\% on the test set in a controlled laboratory environment, and 84.11\\\\% and 75.58\\\\% on the test set in a real-world environment, respectively.

       "  'abstract': 'Recirculating aquaculture has received more and more attention because of its high efficiency of treatment and recycling of aquaculture wastewater. The content of dissolved oxygen is an important indicator of control in recirculating aquaculture, its content and dynamic changes have great impact on the healthy growth of fish. However, changes of dissolved oxygen content are affected by many factors, and there is an obvious time lag between control regulation and effects of dissolved oxygen. To ensure the aquaculture production safety, it is necessary to predict the dissolved oxygen content in advance. The prediction model based on deep belief network has been proposed in this paper to realize the dissolved oxygen content prediction. A variational mode decomposition (VMD) data processing method has been adopted to evaluate the original data space, it takes the data which has been decomposed by the VMD as the input of deep belief network (DBN) to realize the prediction. The VMD method can effectively separate and denoise the raw data, highlight the relations among data features, and effectively improve the quality of the neural network input. The proposed model can quickly and accurately predict the dissolved oxygen content in time series, and the prediction performance meets the needs of actual production. When compared with bagging, AdaBoost, decision tree and convolutional neural network, the VMD-DBN model produces higher prediction accuracy and stability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Localization is the first critical step for picking robots to successfully grasp fruit. However, classical binocular localization methods adopted global matching for kiwifruit, which may result in a large amount of mismatching feature points in complex orchard and thus cause low localization accuracy. Therefore, an improved binocular localization method of calyxes based on deep learning was proposed to accurately detect and locate kiwifruit for robotic harvesting. Calyxes in the binocular images and kiwifruit in the left images of the binocular images were detected using You Only Look Once version 5 xlarge (YOLOv5x). The detected calyxes were matched in the binocular images using kiwifruit and calyx pairing and kiwifruit matching. The matched calyxes in the binocular images were used to locate calyxes using three localization methods. Specifically, three binocular localization methods, i.e., calyx localization (CL), fruit localization (FL), and depth information from depth map (DIDM), were compared to find the optimal one. Ground truth three-dimensional coordinates of calyxes was measured by laser rangefinder and coordinate paper on a self-designed experimental platform. Results showed that YOLOv5x achieved an average precision (AP) of 99.5 \\\\% on kiwifruit detection and a mean AP of 93.5 \\\\% on kiwifruit and calyx detection with a detection speed of 108 ms per image. Average deviation of X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis obtained by the CL method were 7.9 mm, 6.4 mm, and 4.8 mm, respectively. Compared with the FL and DIDM methods, localization error rate of the proposed CL method was reduced by 55.1 \\\\% and 53.8 \\\\%, respectively.

       "  'abstract': 'Digital image recognition has been used in the different aspects of life, mostly in object classification and detections. Monitoring of animal life with image recognition in natural habitats is essential for animal health and production. Currently, Sheep Pain Facial Expression Scale (SPFES) has become the focus of monitoring sheep from facial expression. In contrast, pain level estimation from facial expression is an efficient and reliable mark of animal life. However, the manual assessment is lack of accuracy, time-consuming, and monotonous. Hence, the recent advancement of deep learning in computer vision helps to classify facial expression as fast and accurate. In this paper, we proposed a sheep face dataset and framework that uses transfer learning with fine-tuning for automating the classification of normal (no pain) and abnormal (pain) sheep face images. Current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) based architectures are used to train the sheep face dataset. The data augmentation, L2 regularization, and fine-tuning has been used to prepare the models. The experimental results related to the sheep facial expression dataset achieved 100\\\\% training, 99.69\\\\% validation, and 100\\\\% testing accuracy using the VGG16 model. While employing other pre-trained models, we gained 93.10\\\\% to 98.4\\\\% accuracy. Thus, it shows that our proposed model is optimal for high-precision classification of normal and abnormal sheep faces and can check on a comprehensive dataset. It can also be used to assist other animal life with high accuracy, save time and expenses.',\n",

Plant diseases have a significant effect on the plant quality and yield and they can destroy the entire plant if they are not controlled in time. To minimize disease-related losses, it is essential to identify and control pathogens in the early stages. Plant disease control is thus a fundamental challenge both for global food security and sustainable agriculture. Conventional methods for plant diseases control have given place to electronic control (E-monitoring) due to their lack of portability, being time consuming, need for a specialized user, etc. E-monitoring using electronic nose (e-nose), biosensors, wearable sensors, and ‘electronic eyes' has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Detection, identification, and quantification of pathogens based on electronic sensors (E-sensors) are both convenient and practical and may be used in combination with conventional methods. This paper discusses recent advances made in E-sensors as component parts in combination with wearable sensors, in electronic sensing systems to control and detect viruses, bacteria, pathogens and fungi.

       "  'abstract': 'Shrimp counting is a fundamental operation for biomass estimation in shrimp culture. It is also vital for achieving reasonable feeding and improving breeding efficiency. The application of computer vision technology in the counting of aquatic products is nondestructive and highly efficient. However, owing to the small size, transparent body, and complex background of shrimp in the actual culture environment, existing methods cannot ensure the lightweight of the model applied while satisfying the counting accuracy, and it is difficult to achieve accurate real-time shrimp counting. Therefore, an automatic shrimp counting method using local images and lightweight YOLOv4 (Light-YOLOv4) was proposed in this study. Multiple local shrimp images were randomly cropped from the original top-view images previously collected using image processing technologies to construct a counting dataset. Subsequently, a local shrimp counting model based on Light-YOLOv4 is constructed and trained using transfer learning. Based on the trained model, the number of shrimp in each local shrimp image was predicted. The number of shrimp in the original shrimp image was obtained through a merging process, and the number of shrimp in the culture area was determined using the frame average method. The method was tested on a real shrimp dataset, and the Light-YOLOv4 local shrimp counting model achieved a counting precision of 92.12\\\\%, recall of 94.21\\\\%, F1 value of 93.15\\\\%, and mean average precision of 93.16\\\\%. Compared with other counting models, the proposed method exhibits a better comprehensive performance in terms of the counting accuracy, model size, and detection speed. Furthermore, when shrimp were counted within the entire culture area, the results were consistent with the true values.',\n",

It was easy-to-use and automatic system designed to help rice farmers improve the rice yield and quality. The targeted images were taken from the actual paddy environment without special sample preparation. We used a deep learning neural networks technique to detect rice diseases from the images. We developed an object detection model training and refinement process to improve the performance of our previous research on rice leave diseases detection. The process was based on analyzing the model’s predictive results and could be repeatedly used to improve the quality of the database in the next training of the model. The deployment model for our LINE Bot system was created from the selected best performance technique in our previous paper, YOLOv3, trained by refined training data set. The performance of the deployment model was measured on 5 target classes and found that the Average True Positive Point improved from 91.1\\\\% in the previous paper to 95.6\\\\% in this study. Therefore, we used this deployment model for Rice Disease LINE Bot system. Our system worked automatically real-time to suggest primary diagnosis results to the users in the LINE group, which included rice farmers and rice disease specialists. They could communicate freely via chat. In the real LINE Bot deployment, the model’s performance was measured by our own defined measurement Average True Positive Point and was found to be an average of 78.86\\\\%. The system was fast and took only 2–3 s for detection process in our system server.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Accurate prediction of environmental changes in a greenhouse is crucial for precise control and promoting crop growth. However, the microclimate environment in a greenhouse is nonlinear, temporal, multivariate, and strongly coupled, making it difficult to establish a robust fitting model. To address these issues, this study proposed a variable weight combination prediction model based on attention mechanism optimized Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU-Attention) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO) was employed to optimize the weight coefficients of the predicted values from BiGRU-Attention and LightGBM models at different times. This optimization aimed to enhance the accuracy of predicting air temperature, air humidity, and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) in a greenhouse. In predictions spanning time steps from 30 to 120 min, the variable weight combination prediction model demonstrated superior performance compared to single models and equal weight combination model BiGRU-Attention-LightGBM. At the time step of 120 min, the coefficient of determination R2 for air temperature was 0.9586, air humidity was 0.9232, and PAR was 0.8066. This indicated that the variable weight combination model (PSO-BiGRU-Attention-LightGBM) could more accurately predict the future dynamic trends of climatic environment factors in a greenhouse.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Automatic in-field pest detection and recognition using mobile vision technique is a hot topic in modern intelligent agriculture, but suffers from serious challenges including complexity of wild environment, detection of tiny size pest and classification of multiple classes of pests. While recent deep learning based mobile vision techniques have shown some success in overcoming above issues, one key problem is that towards large-scale multiple species of pest data, imbalanced classes significantly reduce their detection and recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stages mobile vision based cascading pest detection approach (DeepPest) towards large-scale multiple species of pest data. This approach firstly extracts multi-scale contextual information of the images as prior knowledge to build up a context-aware attention network for initial classification of pest images into crop categories. Then, a multi-projection pest detection model (MDM) is proposed and trained by crop-related pest images. The role of MDM can combine pest contextual information from low-level convolutional layers with these in high-level convolutional layers for generating the super-resolved feature. Finally, we utilize the attention mechanism and data augmentation to improve the effectiveness of in-field pest detection. We evaluate our method on our newly established large-scale dataset In-Field Pest in Food Crop (IPFC) and sufficient experimental results show that DeepPest proposed in this paper outperforms state-of-the-art object detection methods in detecting in-field pest.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Early detection and recognition of plant disease is a prerequisite for controlling plant disease, and one of the key steps is to segment plant diseased leaf images. However, this task is challenging because diseased leaf images are often very complex, with irregular shapes, variable sizes, various shapes, rich colors, fuzzy boundaries and messy backgrounds. An improved U-Net (MU-Net) is constructed for plant diseased leaf image segmentation by introducing a residual block (Resblock) and a residual path (Respath). Resblock is introduced into U-Net to overcome gradient disappearance and explosion problems, and 2 Respaths are used instead of 2 skip connections to improve the transformation of corresponding feature information between the contraction path and the expansion path. Furthermore, Resblock and Respath are combined, which can increase the network depth and improve the network’s expression ability. Experimental results on a plant diseased leaf image dataset show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and efficiency of plant diseased leaf image segmentation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dissolved oxygen (DO), an important water quality indicator in aquaculture, affects the survival rate of aquatic creatures and the yield of aquatic production. Therefore, it is important to predict DO in fishery ponds for applying artificial aeration with low energy and cost. Recently, deep learning models, such as recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU), are often used to predict the trend of time series, but it is unclear which one of them is more suitable for prediction of DO in fishery ponds. In this work, the RNN model, LSTM model, and GRU model were used to build three DO predicting models. The performance of the three models were compared by mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). The performance of RNN is worse result than LSTM and GRU. The four evaluation indicators of GRU are 0.450 mg/L, 0.411, 0.054, and 0.994, and the four indicators of LSTM are 0.407 mg/L, 0.294, 0.059, and 0.970, which shows that the performance of GRU is similar to LSTM, but the time cost and number of parameters used for GRU is much lower than LSTM. It is concluded that the GRU has overall better performance and can be applied to practical applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Fish counting is of great significance for aquaculture companies to formulate feeding strategies and management plans. Preceding computer vision methods are difficult to solve the counting problem when the fish body is seriously overlapped and the shape changes greatly. In this research, a deep learning network model based on multi-modules and attention mechanism (MAN) is proposed to realize the counting of cultured fish which consists of feature extraction module, attention module, and density map estimation module. Among them, the feature extraction module is composed of three parallel convolutional networks which is used to extract the general feature map of the image and serves as the input of the subsequent module. The trunk convolutional network and the attention network are connected in parallel to form the attention module which is more precisely identify critical information of image in dense counting process. Thereinto, the attention network integrated a residual block without batch normalization and a convolutional layer. The distribution and the number of fishes in the image is represented by density map estimation module. In order to improve the counting accuracy and retain more details of the image, the sum of squared error (SSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are applied to form the loss function and train the model. In order to explore the generalization ability of the model, data from two tanks were used to validate the model. The experimental results for MAN showed that the counting accuracy is about 97.12\\\\%, and the deviation is 3.67. Compared with the MCNN and CNNs, the accuracy of MAN has been improved by about 1.95\\\\% and 2.76\\\\%. At the same time, the deviation of MAN has also been reduced by 30.23\\\\% and 41.09\\\\%, respectively. For the images of another tank, the counting accuracy of MAN is 94.69\\\\%, while the MCNN and CNNs cannot meet the application requirements of fish counting. Furthermore, the accuracy for MAN between the different distribution intervals of the number of fishes is fluctuating less. On the whole, the model not only has high counting accuracy, but also has strong stability and generalization performance. The method that based on multi-modules and attention mechanism can promote the exploration of the technology related to dense fish counting, and provide a feasible solution for the application of this technology in practical engineering.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Temperature, light and CO2 are three environmental factors that directly affect the photosynthetic rate of plants. Exploring the relationship between these three factors and the photosynthetic rate, and optimizing the environmental conditions, is the key to realize efficient production of greenhouse crops. A nested experiment was carried out to measure the photosynthetic rate of cucumber seedlings under different environmental conditions. On the basis of these data, a photosynthetic rate prediction model was established by using machine learning method. A method that avoiding the excessive consumption of light and CO2 resources and promoting the photosynthetic rate based on U-chord curvature is proposed for more efficient regulation of photosynthetic rate. Under different temperature conditions, the prediction model can be used to construct photosynthetic rate surfaces under the interaction of light and CO2. After the surface is discretized, the maximum U-chord curvature points of discrete light response and CO2 response curves are calculated. These points are fitted by polynomials as the regulation boundary to obtain the target space that can achieve efficient regulation. The prediction model, with temperature, light and CO2 as inputs, had high accuracy, and the regulation method was effective. The determination coefficient and root mean square error of the prediction model were 0.99 and 0.85 µmol·m−2·s−1, respectively. Compared with the traditional maximum photosynthetic rate regulation method, this new method reduced the photosynthetic rate by under 16\\\\%, but saved 41\\\\% of light and 49\\\\% of CO2 inputs, which illustrated this method improved production efficiency while basically maintained maximum photosynthetic rate.',\n",

However, the occlusion, bending, and poor imaging angle of fish body image are still serious challenges for underwater fully automatic mass measurement. The aim of this study was to develop underwater non-contact method to automatically estimate the free-swimming fish mass based on binocular stereo vision technology. The fish body images were automatically selected and obtained by using pattern recognition method based on LabVIEW development platform during the experimental period. All the fish samples were divided into three groups according to mass (200–500 g, 500–800 g, and 800–1200 g), and then subdivided into three groups by imaging angle (orthogonal angles, greater than 45°, and less than 45°). The experiment indicated that the fish mass could be estimated using fish body area with a high coefficient of determination (R2) based on linear model. The mean relative errors between estimated and measured value were 3.37\\\\% (orthogonal angles), 4.95\\\\% (greater than 45° angles), and 16.59\\\\% (less than 45° angles). Significant difference was found in less than 45° group with p {\\\\textless} 0.01.

       "  'abstract': 'Fish school feeding behavior analysis based on images can provide important information for aquaculture managers to make effective feeding decision. However, it is a challenging task due to intra-class variation, cross-occlusion, and unbalanced image categories in real high-density industrial farming. At present, most of the existing works on fish school feeding behavior are limited because they seem to ignored the spatial relationship between the region of interest in fish feeding images. To address this research gap, we propose a dual attention network with Efficientnet-B2 for fine-grained short-term feeding behavior analysis of fish school. The algorithm includes EfficientNet-B2 network and two parallel attention modules, which focus on the feature extraction of the feeding region. In addition, several training strategies, such as mish activation function, ranger optimizer, label smoothing, and cosine annealing, are employed to improve the algorithm performance. Especially, label smoothing technique is used to address the problem of image class imbalance. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, performance of proposed algorithm is analyzed on fish school feeding behavior dataset and it is also compared with benchmark Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) including AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, Densenet, SENet, and MobileNet. Comprehensive experimental results show that proposed algorithm achieves very good results in terms of the accuracy (the test accuracy is 89.56\\\\% on datasets), precision, parameters and floating point operations per second (FLOPS), compared with the benchmark classification algorithm. Therefore, we proposed method can be integrated into aquacultual vision system to guide farmers to plan their feeding strategy.',\n",

In this paper, a novel fish feeding intensity detection method based on the fusion of multiple features (Mel spectrogram, STFT, and CQT feature map) and the LC-GhostNet lightweight network was proposed as an experimental object with Oplegnathus. First, a dataset of feeding sounds of Oplegnathus punctatus was built, in which there are four types: “strong”, “medium”, “weak” and “none”. Next, the Mel, STFT, and CQT feature maps of the feeding sound were extracted using the Librosa library, and then these feature maps were fused by feature image stitching. Lastly, the fused audio feature maps were fed to LC-GhostNet for further feature extraction and classification. Experimental results indicated that the accuracy of the fused feature maps was 97.941\\\\% when used as input, which was 4.053\\\\%, 7.207\\\\%, and 3.003\\\\% higher than that of the single feature Mel, STFT, and CQT, respectively.

       "  'abstract': 'Rapid detection and diagnosis of plant diseases is crucial for healthy crop growth and maintaining harvest quality. Many diseases, such as bacterial spot, late blight, and leaf mould, can affect tomato cultivation. In this paper, a mobile app-based system for intelligent disease detection on tomato leaves is developed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The study uses transfer learning approaches to fine-tune well-known CNN architectures like AlexNet, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.1, VGG19, and DenseNet-121 on a dataset made up of images of tomato leaf from the PlantVillage dataset as well as self-captured images. Over 95\\\\% accuracy is attained by all trained CNN models, with DenseNet-121 leading the pack with a stellar 99.85\\\\%. Consequently, DenseNet-121 is proposed for use with a user-friendly mobile application to detect disease in tomato leaves. A robust user interface in English and two important Indian languages makes this application more accessible to a wider user base.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The layout of orchards usually requires the use of wires, to provide sturdy support. Such is the case of apple trees in fruiting wall architecture, where wires are conducive for mechanical harvesting and especially robotic picking. However, wires may cause damage to the robotic gripper, especially when direct picking occluded apple fruits. Hence, the importance of identifying the wires of a fruit wall architecture. In this study, a pixel-level segmentation network, BlendMask, was adopted to segment wires. The wires are thin and normally behind the branches or leaves, making difficult for their identification. Therefore, a novel data processing algorithm called image overlap-partitioning and stitching (IOS) is proposed for BlendMask to segment the wires. A total of 82 RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) images registered to create a raw dataset. The dataset was augmented and then overlap-partitioned into 12,736 images with a resolution of 800 × 1024 pixels and corresponding annotation files based on input size of BlendMask to make an overlap-partitioned dataset. Then BlendMask was trained with the overlap-partitioned dataset and tested on the other images, where additional stitching for the overlap-partitioned images was needed in the image testing dataset. Results showed that BlendMask with IOS obtained Intersection over Union (IoU) and pixel accuracy of 43.86 \\\\% and 61.01 \\\\%, respectively. It achieved a better average precision of 38.75 \\\\% with IoU of 0.5 on the overlap-partitioned dataset, which was 38.42 \\\\% higher than the full image dataset. Moreover, a reconstruction method based on feature point extraction and fitting was proposed to estimate wire skeletons, which achieved a reconstruction accuracy of 90.70 \\\\%. These results showed a promising potential using segmentation and reconstruction methods for identifying wires and thus providing a basis for robotic picking in modern orchards.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recirculating aquaculture system, the abnormal behavior of fish is usually caused by poor water quality, hypoxia or diseases. Delayed recognition of this behavior will lead to large number of fish deaths. Thus, real-time detection and tracking of fish that behaviors abnormally is an effective way to promote the fish welfare and to improve the survival rate as well as economic benefits of aquaculture. However, due to the high-density breeding, the targets in the fish images are often quite small and in occlusion, which causes high false detection and target loss rate. This article proposes a combined end-to-end neural network to detect and track the abnormal behavior of porphyry seabream. The detection algorithm passes the initial value of the target into the tracking algorithm, and the tracking algorithm tracks subsequent frames to achieve end-to-end abnormal fish behavior detection and achieve high-speed and accurate tracking of abnormal behavior individuals. In the target detection part, YOLOV5s is improved by incorporating multi-level features and adding feature mapping. Compared with the original network, the detection precision AP50:95 is increased by 8.8\\\\% while AP50 reaches 99.4\\\\%. In the target tracking part, this paper achieves multi-target tracking of abnormal fish based on single-target tracking algorithm SiamRPN++. The tracking precision is 76.7\\\\%. By combining the two approaches, individual fish with abnormal behavior can be detected precisely and tracked in real time.',\n",

Deterioration of water quality will directly cause a decline in aquaculture production, and in severe cases, it will cause a large number of deaths of aquatic organisms and serious economic losses to aquaculture enterprises. Therefore, it is important to real-time monitor water quality parameters in aquaculture. In this paper, a water quality monitoring model based on fish behavior is proposed with the oplegnathus punctatus as the research object. We do not need to install complicated equipment, and only need the image data captured by the camera to accomplish the real-time monitoring of water quality parameters. In terms of model, we also added the CBAM attention mechanism, residual module and a series of training strategies, so that the model can focus on the valuable fish behavior information in the image while focusing on the global information. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the model in the validation set can reach 97.2\\\\%, and the inference speed can reach 144.36 FPS.

       "  'abstract': 'Fish behavior detection is extremely important for farmers to get information on life indicators of fish, which could be useful to prevent disease outbreaks, predict water quality changes, and improve fish welfare. However, conventional fish disease detection does not meet real-time detection requirements and could have an irreversible influence on fish. Additionally, abnormal detection based on school behavior does not allow for the detection of early abnormal behavior in single fish. To solve this problem, a novel method of abnormal behavior detection based on image fusion was proposed. Firstly, the outline information of the moving object was extracted based on image processing technology. Secondly, the position information of the fish image was enhanced using mosaic image fusion. Finally, bidirectional feature pyramid network, coordinate attention block, and spatial pyramid pooling were added to YOLOv5, which was named BCS-YOLOv5. And compared with the other two typical models, the BCS-YOLOv5 based image fusion achieved the best accuracy with an average accuracy of 96.69\\\\% at 45 frames per second in four typical behavior datasets. The proposed method not only improves the extraction of location information but also quantitatively detects similar anomalous behavior, which meets the demand for real-time detection of fish abnormal behavior in aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tracking the fish is a key step in analyzing fish behavior, evaluating their health levels, and warning of abnormal water quality, so it is of significant importance for intelligent monitoring in fish farming. However, multi-object tracking for fish is a very challenging task due to foam occlusion in the factory tank, high individual similarity, and fast-paced motion of fish. To address the above issues, an online multi-fish tracking model called FishTrack is proposed with 3 branches of target detection, track prediction, and re-identification, which establishes the motion model and appearance model for fish simultaneously, thus achieving the online multi-fish tracking. It is a complete Encoder-Decoder structure and the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) is adopted as the backbone network to extract multi-level features. Then an Encoder is specially designed to encode the historical information of the positions of fish, and automatically update its spatiotemporal information in an autoregressive fashion, to perform the fusion of the spatiotemporal information of fish targets and avoid manual selection of spatiotemporal features. Finally, a parallel dual-Decoder is used to decode the motion and appearance features of fish to reduce the interference of the two optimization directions during the joint model training. The motion cues are first used in linear assignment to reduce the interference of occlusion and deformation issues, and when the motion model fails to track, the appearance cues can recover the identity to deal with long occlusion. The experiments on the established multiple fish tracking dataset showed that the higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) reached 71.4\\\\%, the multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) reached 94.8\\\\%, the most tracked ratio (MT) reached 93.3\\\\%, and the identification F1 score (IDF1) reached 82.5\\\\%. The results show that FishTrack can solve the problem of tracking accuracy decrease caused by foam occlusion and fish deformation, and save the inference time by sharing features, increasing the robustness of online multi-fish tracking in factory farming.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Dissolved oxygen in water is an important ecological factor in ensuring the healthy growth of aquatic products, as hypoxic stress is known to restrict the growth of aquatic products. The accurate monitoring and prediction of dissolved oxygen is the key to precise regulation and control of pond aquaculture water quality. The current dissolved oxygen prediction model has some limitations, such as a short prediction period and inadequate prediction accuracy for actual production demands. Therefore, a prediction model of dissolved oxygen in pond culture was proposed based on K-means clustering and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. Firstly, the key factors affecting the changes in dissolved oxygen were selected by principal component analysis (PCA). The dissolved oxygen time series was then subjected to K-means clustering, and the dissolved oxygen prediction model was constructed using GRU. To improve the clustering effect, we enhanced the similarity calculation for the time series based on the variation of dissolved oxygen. This process combined the Euclidean distance with the dynamic time-warping distance. The proposed method can predict the dissolved oxygen content of aquaculture water over different time intervals according to the demands of real-world scenarios. The average absolute error of the 30-min interval model was 0.264, and the mean absolute percentage error was 3.5 \\\\%. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method achieves higher prediction accuracy and flexibility than the conventional approach.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Analyzing fish school feeding behavior can assist aquaculturists in making successful feeding decisions, which is critical for enhancing farming efficiency and supporting healthy fish growth. Due to the fierce gathering, jumping, chasing and other actions that occur during fish school feeding, images contain varying degrees of noise and significant overlap between fish targets. Therefore, accurately identifying fish school feeding behavior becomes challenging. To address this problem, the study proposes a MobileNetV2-SENet-based method for identifying fish school feeding behavior. To enhance sample diversity, fish school images are preprocessed with some operations, such as random cropping and brightness-contrast adjustment. Then, MobileNetV2 is used to extract fish school image features, and a feature weighting network based on SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks) is built. Weights are assigned to features with varying degrees of value. The feeding behavior of fish school is identified using the linear classifier. Finally, a method of determining feeding amount is provided based on the identification result to reduce feed consumption. The SENet is introduced in the proposed method based on the original MobileNetV2 feature extraction network, and a feature extraction and weighting network that integrates MobileNetV2 and SENet is built to improve the weights of features relevant for fish school state identification while suppressing the weights of interference elements such as noise, resulting in more accurate identification. The proposed method was tested on the real fish school images and yielded an accuracy of 97.76\\\\%. The accuracy of our model was improved by 3.81\\\\%, 9.99\\\\%, 50.35\\\\%, and 100.37\\\\% when compared to the fish school feeding behavior identification model based on EfficientNet\\\\_B0, ShuffleNetV2, AlexNet, and EfficientNetV2, respectively, indicating that our method can accurately identify the feeding behavior of fish school in real aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In a mushroom greenhouse, for example, there are no sensors that can measure the diameter of clustered mushrooms, and farmers can only empirically estimate the relationship between the mushroom growth and greenhouse microclimate data. Our team developed an image measurement system that can record the circle diameter of Agaricus bisporus (hereinafter referred to as “common mushroom”) caps during the fruiting period. To continuously record the size of the mushroom caps for purpose-specific analysis (such as data analysis for optimized greenhouse microclimate control, calculation of growth rate, or harvest reminder), a new algorithm is proposed for calculating the diameter of the circle of round mushroom caps. This algorithm is used to estimate the mushroom circles using the images continuously captured by a camera and generate a growth record of the mushroom caps. The automatic adjustment of the camera aperture and focus during the growth of the mushroom results in a color deviation between images, which makes it difficult to detect the circles of the mushroom caps. The proposed algorithm is sufficiently robust to overcome the challenges presented by the color deviation in achieving accurate estimation. It is based on the identification results of the convolutional neural network and combines the innovative Score-Punishment (SP) algorithm in this study to calculate the circle diameter of the mushroom caps. The proposed algorithm outperformed the current Circle Hough Transform (OpenCV’s implementation). Besides, the proposed algorithm is more robust without the need to set parameters for the images of each time period, making it more feasible for practical application. In addition to describing the algorithm in detail, in this work, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm through experiments were also verified.',\n",

Determining the level of fish appetite helps optimize fish production and design more efficient aquaculture smart feeding systems. Given an aquaculture surveillance video, our goal is to improve fish feeding intensity evaluation by proposing a two-stage approach: an optical flow neural network is first applied to generate optical flow frames, which are then inputted to a 3D convolution neural network (3D CNN) for fish feeding intensity evaluation. Using an aerial drone, we capture RGB water surface images with significant optical flows from an aquaculture site during the fish feeding activity. The captured images are inputs to our deep optical flow neural network, consisting of the leading neural network layers for video interpolation and the last layer for optical flow regression. Our optical flow detection model calculates the displacement vector of each pixel across two consecutive frames. To construct the training dataset of our CNNs and verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we manually annotated the level of fish feeding intensity for each training image frame. In this paper, the fish feeding intensity is categorized into four, i.e., ‘none,’ ‘weak,’ ‘medium’ and ‘strong.’ We compared our method with other state-of-the-art fish feeding intensity evaluations. Our proposed method reached up to 95 \\\\% accuracy, which outperforms the existing systems that use CNNs to evaluate the fish feeding intensity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the plant cultivation, pruning is a crucial stage to improve plant metabolism. A robot may be employed for efficient pruning. Before leaf pruning, the robot must distinguish leaves from branches. Aligned images of a golden melon plant captured using a Red-Green-Blue-Depth (RGB-Depth) camera were used for modeling. The images were captured using different light intensities, distances, heights, and shooting angles. This study employs the faster region convolutional neural network (Faster R–CNN) method using RGB-Depth Camera. Faster R–CNN was developed in 10 epochs and had two scenarios (Scenarios 1 and 2) using two intersections over union (IoU) threshold values (30\\\\% and 70\\\\%) for testing. Scenario 1 (IoU threshold 30\\\\%) had a better score for aggregate testing data with 70.02\\\\% than Scenario 2. The correlation between the intensity and mean average precision score was −0.292. There is no impact on the model for the sample of testing data at every distance and degree. We conclude that using an IoU threshold on region proposal influences the scores.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Variety identification of seeds is essential for evaluating seed purity and ensuring crop yields. Hyperspectral imaging is a mainstream nondestructive testing method for seed purity. The hyperspectral data contains spectral and spatial information, which is large and redundant. According to the characteristics of hyperspectral data, this study used spectral feature intervals coupled with a grouped convolutional network to construct a seed variety identification model. Firstly, three spectral wavelength interval selection methods are used to constrain the spectrum, which are interval continuum removal (iCR), backward interval partial least squares (BiPLS), and interval random frog (iRF). Since spectral feature intervals in the hyperspectral image represent different physical and chemical characteristics, it is more effective to extract features of each interval independently by group convolution (GC). Then, the features are integrated into the network structure. The results showed that the combination of feature wavelength and grouping convolution enabled classification models effectively to obtain better classification accuracy and improve the inference speed of the model. The iCR-GC CNN model had the highest classification accuracy with a 4.4\\\\% increase and the fastest inference speed with a 44.21\\\\% reduction by comparing with the reference CNN classification model.',\n",

In commercial farms, the use of surveillance video to track and monitor dairy goats is conducive to improving production efficiency and commercial welfare. In this paper, an algorithm-based on Siamese strategy is presented for the automated tracking of a single dairy goat in the surveillance video. The Dairy Goat Dataset (DG-dataset) containing 200 dairy goat motion videos with a total of 161,000 frames of images randomly collected from the farm was created, and the ImageNet VID, Youtube-BB, and GOT-10 k were used for training. First, the proposed tracker named SiamBNAN employs an effective and highly modular backbone network constructed by the Multi-Convolution Residual Blocks (MCRBs) and Down-sampling Multi-Convolution Residual Blocks (D-MCRBs). The MCRBs and D-MCRBs replace the original square convolution kernel with a kernel augmented by asymmetric convolution kernels and perform a set of group convolutions. Finally, the Regional Proposal Network (RPN) is used for foreground-background classification and proposal regression. The experimental results show that this algorithm outperforms SiamFC, SiamRPN, and SiamRPN + in terms of both Expected Average Overlap (EAO), Robustness (R), Success Rate (Succ), and Precision (Prec) on the DG-dataset. The SiamBNAN runs at 70 fps with low computing space requirements showing that it is effective and could be used for monitoring the behavior of dairy goats in the real farming scene.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Decision-making with low-cost data is an attractive approach in the field of agriculture as it aids to solve the difficulty of inheriting advanced cultivation technologies. To provide expertise in the decision-making process for stress cultivation, precision irrigation based on plant water stress is required to steadily produce high-quality fruits. Single low-cost data namely, single-modal data, is used in the traditional approach. However, for advanced cultivation, multimodal data such as physiological and meteorological data is required. In this study, we propose a multimodal neural network with clustering-based drop (C-Drop) for accurate estimation of plant water stress, as it is an index for irrigation decision-making, using plant image and environmental data. Our proposed method extracts temporal multimodal features from leaf wilting features (physiological data) using environmental features (meteorological data) as an attention mechanism of a multimodal neural network that includes long short-term memory layers. Moreover, the proposed neural network with C-drop realizes a novel end-to-end deep learning architecture in consideration of environmental conditions. On evaluating this method against the existing methods, the proposed method was found to improve the accuracy of plant water stress estimation by 21\\\\% for mean absolute error and root-mean-squared error, thereby indicating that this method is precise and stable for the plant water stress estimation. The performance of our proposed method to support precision irrigation will allow new-age farmers to produce high-quality fruits steadily.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is not only essential for irrigation management but also difficult to estimate and measure. The classical “two-step” approach of ETc estimation, using the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and the crop coefficient (Kc), is utilised worldwide. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of artificial neural networks (ANN) for ETc estimations in closed soilless culture systems. Tomato (cv. Duru) plants were grown in two substrates, perlite and coco fibre, in an unheated plastic greenhouse. During the growing seasons (2 spring and fall periods each) daily climatic values, ETc and Kc were determined. FAO Penman-Monteith (PM) was used as the general approach for ETc estimation in addition to Hargreaves (HG) for limited data conditions. ANN models were generated with 4 data sets: (1) all inputs, (2) without radiation (-Rs), (3) without Kc (-Kc), and (4) minimum data (-Rs -Kc), and all were compared implementing PM and HG equations. The Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) was used to assess the predictive skill of the models. Average Kc values of 0.40–1.31–0.61 and 0.40–1.76–0.77 were obtained for perlite and coco fibre, respectively. The ANN models for all input conditions produced successful results, improving estimation accuracy over traditional equations. For all data sets, the average RMSE and model efficiency values (RMSE = 0.540 mm day−1 and E = 0.817) of ANN models for perlite and coco fibre, were better than those obtained from the PM (RMSE = 0.667 mm day−1 and E = 0.759). The ANN (+1) models forecasted ETc with E = 0.861 and 0.532 RMSE for coco fibre, and with E = 0.797 and 0.522 RMSE for perlite. It was concluded that ANN models used for site-specific ETc predictions perform better than classical methods in soilless culture, and can be implemented into automation systems with forecasting ability to assist irrigation management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Improving efficiency with the use of rainfall is one of the effective ways to conserve water in agriculture. At present, weather forecasting can be used to potentially conserve irrigation water, but the risks of unnecessary irrigation and the yield loss due to the uncertainty of weather forecasts should be avoided. Thus, a deep Q-learning (DQN) irrigation decision-making strategy based on short-term weather forecasts was proposed to determine the optimal irrigation decision. The utility of the method is demonstrated for paddy rice grown in Nanchang, China. The short-term weather forecasts and observed meteorological data of the paddy rice growth period from 2012 to 2019 were collected from stations near Nanchang. Irrigation was decided for two irrigation decision-making strategies, namely, conventional irrigation (i.e., flooded irrigation commonly used by local farmers) and DQN irrigation, and their performance in water conservation was evaluated. The results showed that the daily rainfall forecasting performance was acceptable, with potential space for learning and exploitation. The DQN irrigation strategy had strong generalization ability after training and can be used to make irrigation decisions using weather forecasts. In our case, simulation results indicated that compared with conventional irrigation decisions, DQN irrigation took advantage of water conservation from unnecessary irrigation, resulting in irrigation water savings of 23 mm and reducing drainage by 21 mm and irrigation timing by 1.0 times on average, without significant yield reduction. The DQN irrigation strategy of learning from past irrigation experiences and the uncertainties in weather forecasts avoided the risks of imperfect weather forecasting.',\n",

The high level of ammonia nitrogen is likely to cause deterioration of water quality and mass death of cultured subjects. Therefore, accurate detection of the cultured water ammonia nitrogen content is crucially important for aquaculture management. While, at present, the accuracy of equipment for measuring the ammonia nitrogen content of aquaculture water in real time cannot meet the requirements for aquaculture. In this paper, the soft computing method is firstly proposed to predict the ammonia nitrogen content in aquaculture water in real time. This method includes empirical mode decomposition (EMD), improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and extreme learning machine (ELM). To evaluate the performance of the soft computing techniques, three different statistic indicators were used, including root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to compare three artificial soft computing methods. Results showed that the EMD-IPSO-ELM soft computing method showed the best performance among other studied methods in the ammonia nitrogen real time prediction. The EMD-IPSO-ELM model provides moderately and roughly accurately real time prediction value of ammonia nitrogen in aquaculture water.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In autonomous rice harvesting, the use of transporters to assist rice transportation is an effective way to improve efficiency. However, nonlinear systems, such as double Hydraulic Static Transmission (HST)-driven tracked rice harvesters and transporters, make it challenging to control the precise parallel parking alignment during transportation, often leading to rice loss and potential safety hazards. To address this issue, this study established a geometric cotransporter model and used a preset path to decouple a two-dimensional control problem into two sets of one-dimensional controls. Dynamic and kinematic models of the longitudinal drive and steering systems were analyzed. Based on the identified longitudinal drive system transfer function, a predictive model was constructed to predict and compensate for the parking slip caused by system inertia. It was combined with the integrator wind-up protection to improve the pure tracking method and eliminate or reduce system errors in path tracking. A parallel parking alignment control system was designed using these two methods, and comparative experiments were conducted on the road surface. The results demonstrate that the compensated predictor (CP) longitudinal control improves the alignment accuracy compared with the proportional differential (PD) controller, whereas the Improved Pure-Pursuit Control (IPPC) path-tracking slightly enhances the tracking accuracy compared with proportional integral (PI).

Image-based plant nutrition analysis is based on this principle and focus on the relationships between plant nutrition content and phenotyping changes, such as leaf color, leaf texture, height, light reflectance ratio, etc. As a non-destructive method, imaging technology can be deployed to support automated plant diagnose and production. Current imaging technologies used in plant nutrition analysis include red–green–blue (RGB) imaging, imaging spectroscopy and fluorescence imaging. This article summarizes the development of imaging technologies for plant nutrition analysis over the past decade and presents their basic concepts and principles. The pros and cons of each imaging method are discussed and future research directions are highlighted. We focus on imaging applications describing the phenotyping of plant canopy instead of root architecture. Advancement in imaging technology has greatly accelerated the application of image-based plant nutrition analysis.

       "  'abstract': 'Dissolved oxygen (DO) content is a significant indicator of water quality in intensive aquaculture ponds and is profoundly related to healthy fish growth. Accurately forecasting DO and analysing its change trends in aquaculture ponds is crucial for fish survival. A novel forecasting model based on a combination of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with an adaptive noise Lempel-Ziv complex (CEEMDAN-LZC) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with a generalized opposition-based learning particle swarm optimization algorithm (GOBLPSO) has been proposed to improve the prediction precision of DO. The DO content numerical sequence was decomposed and reconstructed into several new features by the CEEMDAN-LZC method in the modelling process. Independent models were structured to fit the components obtained above using GRUs, and the prediction value was superimposed to obtain the ultimate result. Furthermore, the time-step parameter t and the unit number parameter u, which significantly influence the performance of the GRU, were selected by the GOBLPSO algorithm. The simulation results based on DO content data in river crab culture ponds show that the proposed model has excellent essential feature extraction capability and is very powerful and reliable for DO content prediction in aquaculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The significant role of plants can be observed through the dependency of animals and humans on them. Oxygen, materials, food and the beauty of the world are contributed by plants. Climate change, the decrease in pollinators, and plant diseases are causing a significant decline in both quality and coverage ratio of the plants and crops on a global scale. In developed countries, above 80 percent of rural production is produced by sharecropping. However, due to widespread diseases in plants, yields are reported to have declined by more than a half. These diseases are identified and diagnosed by the agricultural and forestry department. Manual inspection on a large area of fields requires a huge amount of time and effort, thereby reduces the effectiveness significantly. To counter this problem, we propose an automatic disease detection and classification method in radish fields by using a camera attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to capture high quality images from the fields and analyze them by extracting both color and texture features, then we used K-means clustering to filter radish regions and feeds them into a fine-tuned GoogleNet to detect Fusarium wilt of radish efficiently at early stage and allow the authorities to take timely action which ensures the food safety for current and future generations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The apple fruits captured from red green and blue (RGB) color camera cannot be accurately identified and localized under natural scenes of orchards due to lighting and shading. We propose a pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) orchard heterogeneous image fusion model for semantic segmentation of saliency regions. The purpose of the model is to improve the accuracy of image segmentation and the quality of heterogeneous source image fusion in complex orchard scenes. The model fuses the time of flight (ToF) and RGB images acquired from orchard scenes. This model consists of an orchard image semantic segmentation module, a parameter optimization module, and a dual PCNN image fusion module. Image semantic segmentation module extracts the significant regions of fruit targets in orchard images. And then, in parameter optimization module, we introduce tent chaos and ranking strategies into human mental search algorithm to optimize the parameters of PCNN model. Finally, we complete the fusion through a dual PCNN module. Six fusion algorithms were used to evaluate the fusion quality of public and self-built datasets. The results showed that the chaotic hierarchical mental search algorithm could better solve the problem of difficult-to-determine PCNN parameters. The improved DeeplabV3 + could also segment clearer and more complete apple regions. Compared with other six fusion algorithms, the fusion experimental results show that the fused images with clearer targets and more prominent textures could be obtained in the proposed model. The proposed model reduces the influence of light and other disturbing factors in fruit recognition. And the fused image contains rich and accurate image information, which is more in line with the perception habit of human eyes.',\n",

With respect to cow identification, methods based on computer vision have been widely considered due to their advantage of non-contact and practicality. In this paper, a novel non-contact cow identification method based on fusion of deep parts features is proposed. First, a set of side-view images of cows were captured, and then the YOLO object detection model was applied to locate the cow object in each original image, which was then divided into three parts, head, trunk and legs, by a part segmentation algorithm using frame differencing and segmentation span analysis. Then, three independent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to extract deep features from these three parts, and a feature fusion strategy was designed to fuse the features, i.e., deep parts feature fusion. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained by the fused features was used to identify each individual cow. The proposed method achieved 98.36\\\\% cow identification accuracy on a dataset containing side-view images of 93 cows, which outperformed existing works. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed cow identification method and the good potential for this method in individual identification of other livestock.',\n",

However, different cultivars have different physicochemical properties and spectral response distributions, resulting the model established for one cultivar have poor prediction performance, even couldn’t been used, for another. Redesigning model can solve this problem, but it requires a large number of samples, high costs, and much time and effort. In case of small samples, how to realize model transfer from one cultivar to another to improve prediction precision is a difficult problem. To solve this problem, 'Huayou' (Actinidia chinensis) and 'Xuxiang' (Actinidia deliciosa) kiwifruit, two different cultivars in two different species and widely planted in Shaanxi province, China, were chosen as samples to investigate the model’s transfer performance between different cultivars using three algorithms, i.e., model updating, transfer component analysis and Two-stage TrAdaBoost.R2 (TTB), and the effect of different numbers of target domain samples on model performance was also investigated. The results indicated that the built partial least squares regression model based on TTB had better performance in predicting the soluble solids content of another cultivar, and the TTB could solve the heterogeneity of different cultivars and achieve the model transfer. The transferred model achieved the best prediction accuracy when the number of target domain samples was 100, confirming that the TTB had greater potential in solving data scarcity and in realizing small sample learning.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), fish feeding is the most important part in production management, which is not only related to economic benefits, but also the key to ensure fish welfare and increase production. At present, in RAS, fish are basically fed either artificially or automatically (quantitatively supply feed at definite time), which can easily result in under-feeding or over-feeding of fish. Therefore, there is an urgent to develop an intelligent method that realizes appropriate feeding according to the actual demands of fish. This research attempts to explore a fish dynamic feeding method based on the multi-task network to meet the automatic adjustment of both the feeding intervals (the time intervals between feeding points in repeated feeding in a single-round) and feeding rates. The specific objectives of this study include two parts: 1) to construct a multi-task network to analyze the feeding activity of cultured fish and monitor the amount of uneaten feed pellets; 2) to design a feeding strategy based on information obtained from the multi-task network that realizes the dynamic adjustment of feeding intervals and the decision of feeding endpoint. The waste of feed pellets can be reduced by dynamically adjusting the feeding intervals, and the under-feeding and over-feeding of fish can be prevented by determining feeding endpoint. The results indicated that the accuracy of feeding activity classification by multi-task network reached 95.44\\\\%, and the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) in uneaten feed pellet counting were 4.80 and 6.75, which indicate that the multi-task network can accurately monitor the fish feeding activity and the amount of uneaten feed pellets. Based on the two monitored information, combined with the feeding strategy, we dynamically adjusted the feeding intervals and determined the feeding endpoint, and then compared the feeding endpoints with manual judgment to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the dynamic feeding method based on the multi-task network. In summary, this research provides a more accurate and efficient solution for the intelligent and precise feeding of cultured fish, and provides the theoretical foundation for the development of intelligent feeding devices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Apples in modern orchards with vertical-fruiting-wall trees are comparatively easier to harvest and specifically suitable for robotic picking, where accurate apple detection and obstacle-free access are fundamentally important. However, field images have complex backgrounds because of the presence of nontarget trees and fruit in adjacent rows. An outdoor machine vision system was developed with a low-cost Kinect V2 sensor to improve the accuracy of apple detection by filtering the background objects using depth features. A total of 800 set images were acquired in a commercial fruiting-wall Scifresh apple orchard with dense-foliage canopy. Images were collected in both daytime and nighttime with artificial light. The sensor was kept at 0.5 m to the tree canopies. A depth threshold of 1.2 m was used to remove background. Two Faster R–CNN based architectures ZFNet and VGG16 were employed to detect the Original-RGB and the Foreground-RGB images. Results showed that the highest average precision (AP) of 0.893 was achieved for the Foreground-RGB images with VGG16, which cost 0.181 s on average to process a 1920 × 1080 image. AP values for the Foreground-RGB images with ZFNet and VGG16 were both higher than those of the Original-RGB images. The results indicated that the use of a depth filter to remove background trees improved fruit detection accuracy by 2.5\\\\% and that only a minimal difference was found in processing speed between two image datasets. The proposed technique and results are expected to be applicable for robotic harvesting on fruiting-wall apple orchards.',\n",

The self-supervised semantic segmentation model groups the semantically similar pixels by iteratively referring to the self-contained information, allowing the pixels of the same semantic object to be jointly considered by the color-based leaf segmentation algorithm for identifying the leaf regions.

Nonetheless, the degradation problems of marine fishery underwater images hamper further interpretation and analysis of underwater information by computer vision technology. In order to comprehensively solve the problems of degradation in marine fishery underwater images, this paper proposes an end-to-end integrated dual-channel network model, which uses the underwater image enhancement module based on the residual dense network to perform color correction and dehazing for the low-frequency layer of images, and the marine snow removal module based on local residual learning strategy to remove the white marine snow in the high-frequency layer of images. Moreover, the addition of refinement module further improves the textual details and colors of images. Experimental results on marine fishery dataset indicate that the approach proposed in this paper performs better than several state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics, including underwater image quality measure (UIQM), blur index and smooth index, effective in improving the contrast of underwater fishery images and reducing marine snow noise, while achieving better visual quality in qualitative evaluation such as color correction, dehazing, detail and feature restoration.

Advanced control algorithms usually track setpoints through continuous control inputs. These setpoints cannot guarantee maximum profit, which can be treated as the control objective of the optimal control algorithm. This paper investigated on–off optimal control algorithms based on two-time-scale decomposition. Mixed-integer nonlinear dynamic programming is used in the fast subproblem to quantify the influence of restricting different control inputs to be integers on the control objective and the CPU time. Results show that compared with continuous control inputs, a decrease of 2.21 ¥·m−2 in the control objective and an increase of 7.84·103 s in the CPU time can be found when defining all control inputs to be integers with 12 collocation points in one day. The methods of sorting and pulse width modulation are used to simulate the receding horizon optimal control in the whole growing period. Results show that compared with continuous control inputs, decreases of 83.54 ¥·m−2 and 4.45 ¥·m−2 can be found with the methods of sorting and pulse width modulation.

       "  'abstract': \"The fish weight, which indicates the growth rate of fish, is a crucial factor that optimizes the feeding rate and shapes the life history of fish in recirculating aquaculture systems. Estimating or predicting fish weight is essential for achieving better control of the output of an aquaculture system. However, many difficulties arise from the lack of direct measurement of fish weight. Currently, aquaculture sensors that directly estimate the fish's weight are unavailable. Additionally, the fish growth model that relies on the fish weight is affected by various environmental factors like water temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and light, increasing the difficulty in estimating the weight. This paper proposes an extended Kalman filter approach for assessing the fish weight from directly available measurements of the fish stocking density and dissolved oxygen. The extended Kalman approach relies on a new version of the fish population growth model, which includes the fish population and dissolved oxygen dynamics. The simulation results demonstrate that the extended Kalman filter algorithm achieves good weight estimation in the nominal case and the presence of process and measurement noises.\",\n",

Several automatic disease detection techniques that improve detection time and improve accuracy compared to visual methods exist, yet they are not suitable for immediate detection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid convolution neural network (CNN) model to speed up the detection of fall armyworms (faw) infested maize leaves. Specifically, the proposed system combines unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, to autonomously capture maize leaves, and a hybrid CNN model, which is based on a parallel structure specifically designed to take advantage of the benefits of both individual models, namely VGG16 and InceptionV3. We compare the performance of the proposed model in terms of accuracy and training time to four existing CNN models, namely VGG16, InceptionV3, XceptionNet, and Resnet50. The results show that compared to existing models, the proposed hybrid model reduces the training time by 16\\\\% to 44\\\\% compared to other models while exhibiting the most superior accuracy of 96.98\\\\%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Traditional methods for determining stress level in live fish rely on biochemical tests such as blood glucose and cortisol measurement. However, these methods are plagued by time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures. To address this issue, this study introduces an electrical impedance spectroscopy electrode system based on three different materials and four distinct shapes. Additionally, an electrical impedance spectroscopy measurement system is developed for monitoring the stress level of perch during cryogenic waterless live transportation. The experiments conducted aim to assess the impact of various electrode materials and shapes on measurement accuracy while effectively gauging the stress level of perch by monitoring changes in muscle contraction. The findings reveal that the lamellar ipsilateral copper electrode stands out as the most effective choice for monitoring perch stress level. Furthermore, the stress level in perch is categorized into five stages: acute stress, in vivo regulation stress, adaptation stress, cumulative stress, and the near-death stress within 12 h. This categorization is achieved through data mining and morphological characteristic parameter extraction, aligning closely with standard blood glucose data. The stress level prediction model, based on an artificial neural network (ANN), demonstrates remarkable accuracy, achieving a prediction rate of 91.66\\\\%. This result underscores the effectiveness of the system. This study contributes to enhancing the health management of live fish during transportation and represents a significant step towards advancing smart fisheries development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this study, a novel method for quantitatively detecting the moisture content of corn by olfactory visualization technology is proposed. First of all, an olfactory visualization system was developed to obtain odor information of corn samples with varying moisture contents using sensor arrays. The sensor array was constructed with twelve chemical dyes, which helped assemble the system. Then, the RreliefF algorithm was utilized to sort the characteristic variables of the sensor image by weight, and the analytical model based on different combinations of input features was built using support vector regression (SVR). Moreover, the ability of three optimization algorithms, namely grid search (GS), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and dung beetle optimizer (DBO), was compared to determine their effectiveness in optimizing the parameters of the SVR model. The results reveal that the RreliefF-GS-SVR model demonstrates an enhanced correlation coefficient of prediction (RP), with an increase from 0.97 to 0.98, as well as the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), is reduced from 0.66\\\\% to 0.53\\\\% when compared to the GS-SVR model. Similarly, in comparison to the RreliefF-GS-SVR model and RreliefF-PSO-SVR model, the RreliefF-DBO-SVR model shows better predictive performance, with an increase in RP to 0.99 and a decrease in RMSEP to 0.25\\\\%.

       "  'abstract': 'Infrared thermal imaging has acquired remarkable acceptance in the agricultural field for numerous applications ranging from irrigation scheduling, crop yield estimation, plant disease detection, fruit maturity evaluation, bruise detection to nursery monitoring. This paper presents a practical application of thermal imaging for irrigation scheduling of horticulture plants under different irrigation treatments. Four similar hibiscus potted plants were considered under different water conditions (slight, mild, moderate, and severe water stress). The thermal images were obtained from different canopy zones (front view, top view, left side view, right side view, and front angle view) using a ground-based hand-held thermal camera. The main objectives of the present study include (i) finding the effect of different irrigation treatments on potted plants and a corresponding change in their thermal signature, (ii) finding a relation between plant-based variables and soil-based variables, and to further develop a threshold value for irrigation scheduling (iii) to compare and simplify the calculation of the temperature of the canopy (Tc) and water stress indices namely crop water stress index (CWSI) and stomatal conductance index (Ig) using various reference and non-reference thresholding techniques and to improve their diagnostic accuracy. We can establish quantitative relationships between plant and soil-based parameters. The relationship between temperature of canopy (Tc) and temperature of soil (Ts) pair is best suited to find the plant under water stress. The threshold value pair (Tc and Ts) for the plants under study are 29.5°C (Tc) and 28°C (Ts) for plant A, 29.5°C (Tc) and 27.5°C (Ts) for plant B, 29.5°C (Tc) and 27°C (Ts) for plant C, and 29.5°C (Tc) and 26.5°C (Ts) for plant D. The most suitable method in terms of applicability and scalability, is histogram gradient thresholding (HG) method to determine Tc accurately. The critical m (for standard deviation envelope thresholding SDE method) and ratio of pixel change (RPC) (for HG method) value estimated can be considered an important indicator of water stress in the plants. Among different approaches to compute water stress indices, simplified and HG methods have minimum root mean square error (RMSE) for plants A, B, C, and D compared to statistical and SDE methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The vital food crop in the agriculture field is rice, but rice growing is impacted by numerous maladies. The Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) disease influences rice standards. Prevailing research practices have less accuracy and could not surmount the noise of the images. This paper proposed Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse Weight-related Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MPW-DCNN) overcomes such complications for the BLB disease identification system. The proposed method encompasses six phases. First, the Image Acquisition (IA) procedure is accomplished, next the pre-processing is carried out, in which the noise of the input rice leaf image is mitigated using the Hybrid Gaussian-Weiner (HGW) filter, and the image pixel is normalized by utilizing min-max normalization. Then, the segmentation of the input image is done by Improved Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM). Next, the features, such as entropy, energy, correlation, contrast, homogeneity, colour histogram, and Scale-Invariant Feature Transforms (SIFT) are extracted from the segmented image. Then, the efficient features are chosen by applying the Exhaustiveness and Brownian Motion-related Elephant Herding Optimization (EBM-EHO) algorithm. Then, these selected features are fed to the MPW-DCNN classifier, which categorizes the image as 'BLB malady' or ‘normal’ or else 'chances being influenced by other maladies'. Lastly, the proposed MPW-DCNN performance is equated with the prevailing classification algorithm, and better accuracy is proffered by the proposed work than the prevalent algorithms. The accuracy of the implemented approach is 2.36, 3.08, 4.62, 5.13, and 6.15\\\\% improved than the existing methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) + Deep features, AlexNet, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), respectively.\",\n",

The changes of water quality parameters have the characteristics of non-linearity, dynamics, variability and complexity. We propose a novel water quality prediction model for pH, water temperature and dissolved oxygen, namely Double-Attention-Based Bidirectional Simple Recurrent Unit model (DA-Bi-SRU). First, we construct a new huge original dataset collected in time series, consisting of 23,000 sets of data. Then, the collected water quality parameters are sequentially preprocessed. Finally, we introduce a dual attention mechanism module for feature extraction and temporal sequences in the Bi-SRU model. Using the correlations between the water quality parameters and temporal dependencies information, the proposed model can significantly improve the accuracy of long-term prediction of water quality. The experimental results show that our DA-Bi-SRU model has higher prediction accuracy than the methods based on RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Bi-SRU, and the prediction accuracy can reach 93.06\\\\%. Therefore, in smart mariculture, farmers can know the changing trend of water quality in advance through our proposed method, and take timely countermeasures before the deterioration of aquaculture ecology.',\n",
