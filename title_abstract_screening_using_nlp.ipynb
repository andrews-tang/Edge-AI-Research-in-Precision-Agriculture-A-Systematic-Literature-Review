       "  'abstract': 'With the commercial deployment of the 5G system, researchers from both academia and industry are moving attention to the blueprint of the 6G system. The space–air–ground–sea integrated 6G system is envisioned to support various new applications with very diverse requirements in terms of quality of service and security. Due to the open nature of the wireless channel, highly dynamic network topology, and mission-critical applications, 6G will face various security threats. The conventional upper-layer cryptography-based security mechanisms face multiple challenges to resist physical layer attacks in the context of large numbers computing, power-limited low-cost Internet of Thing (IoT) devices. The Physical layer security (PLS) mechanisms by exploiting the random nature of the wireless channel and intrinsic hardware imperfection provide complementary approaches to secure the 6G system. Meanwhile, the quick development and successful application of artificial intelligence facilitate the advancement of PLS solutions. In this paper, we make a comprehensive overview of machine learning-empowered PLS techniques toward 6G. We first introduce the vision of the 6G system, typical applications, key enabling radio technologies, security threats, and security requirements to 6G. Then typical machine learning (ML) methods and the driving forces for introducing intelligent PLS in 6G are presented. Afterward, the major academic works on PLS oriented to key 6G radio techniques including cell-free massive MIMO, visible light communication, Terahertz technology, configurable intelligent surfaces, molecular communication, and ambient backscatter communication are discussed. Then, the latest works on ML-enabled PLS solutions including physical layer key generation, secure wireless transmission, physical layer authentication, intelligent anti-jamming, and ML-enabled attack and detection are systematically reviewed. Finally, we identify important open issues and future research opportunities to inspire further studies to realize a more intelligent and secure 6G system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes have become a crucial issue that urgently needs to be addressed due to global environmental change. Many studies have employed remote sensing data for assessing LULC changes, however, the investigation of fragmentation probability modeling is still scarce in the existing literature. Thus, the coupling of bagging, random forest (RF), random subspace (RSS), and their ensemble model with multi-temporal datasets within the GIS environment makes it possible to model the fragmentation probability of LULC in the Teesta River Basin (TRB), Bangladesh. The number of patch (NP), edge density (ED), largest patch index (LPI), contagion index (\\\\%) (CONTAG), aggregation index (AI), perimeter area ratio (P/A ratio), the class area (CA), percentage of landscape (PLAND), patch density (PD), total edge (TE), largest shape index (LSI) and total core area (TCA) were the landscape and class matrices, which were derived from the LULC maps using FRAGSTATS software. The machine learning-based sensitivity models, such as decision tree and support vector machine-based feature selection techniques were implemented to explore the influence of the parameters for fragmentation probability modeling. The results showed that water bodies and barren land were substantially decreased by (6.21\\\\%), and (14.59\\\\%) respectively while the built-up areas increased by 1.45\\\\% from 2010 to 2019. Results revealed that the dominance of the agricultural area has been increased as human interference has been elevated in the TRB. However, twelve class-level and landscape matrices were used to delineate the fragmentation probability zone with the aid of bagging, RF, and RSS algorithms. LULC images and fragmentation probability models were validated using the kappa coefficient and the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The validation outcomes depicted that the three models such as bagging (AUC = 0.864), RF (AUC = 0.819), RSS (AUC = 0.859), and ensemble model (AUC = 0.912) have a good capability to appraise the fragmentation probability, and ensemble model has the highest precision level among three models. Nearly 49\\\\% (1789 km2) of the LULC was under a high to very high fragmentation potential zone that requires to be protected with direct measures. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the number of patches significantly influenced the fragmentation probability model, while the largest patch index was the least sensitive parameter for modeling.',\n",

Over 50\\\\% of the surveyed communities were found to be resilient towards arsenicosis patients.

The LRCV also scored the highest kappa value of 0.52, followed by GNB (0.48), SVC (0.48), Kn (0.46), RF (0.42), and DT (0.31). Caste, education, occupation, housing status, sanitation behaviors, trust in others, non-profit and private organizations, social capital, and awareness played a key role in shaping social resilience towards arsenicosis patients. The authors opine that LRCV and GNB could be promising methods to develop models on similar data generated from a risk society.\",\n",

More importantly, this outlier event demonstrates the surgical, hybridised manner in which China has utilised these emerging technologies in containing its spread (i.e. “AI Epidemiological Targeting”) and set itself on the path to unleashing their full potential (i.e. “AI Symbiosis Paradigm”). Nonetheless, China still needs to harness its rapidly advancing AI prowess in identifying COVID-19's pathogenesis and developing a proven vaccine. Originality/value This study presents a pioneering effort to analyse the deployment of AI and its ecosystem in the “war” against COVID-19.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Energy Neutrality is the need of the hour for future Cyber-physical infrastructure. Many past research works suggest low duty cycle networking for energy-efficient wireless sensor network; however, research problem still persist as these proposals have some practical deployment bottlenecks like sleep-latency and may trade-off with data-fidelity and Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters. The research objective of this work is to propose a novel design for wireless sensor–actuator mote system to minimize energy consumption and compensate with harvesting to achieve energy neutral operation in multi-hop Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN); A network scenario that is much needed for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications in future ready Next-gen Cyber Physical System (NG-CPS). In this paper, we have proposed a novel state-of-the-art Multi-Access/Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) assisted Low-Duty-Cycle Scheduling of Trans-Receiver for Store-Process-Then-Forward (LDCS-TR-SPTF) scheme in multi-hop WSAN for reducing the overall energy consumption. In addition to energy conservation, we have also proposed a hybrid harvesting to compensate energy to achieve energy neutral self-sustainable NG-CPS. The proposed novel LDCS-TR-SPTF has been implemented on multiple custom-made sensor–actuator motes equipped with ARM-based System-on-Chip (SoC) and IEEE 802.11 network interface. These motes are working both as end-nodes and relay nodes in a multi-hop WSAN testbed scenario for testing and validation of our proposed scheme. The results are promising with an overall energy conservation of 49.1\\\\% using our novel LDCS-TR-SPTF in comparison to stock IEEE 802.11. We have implemented solar energy harvester on wireless sensor–actuator motes to compensate the reduced energy consumption and achieved complete energy-neutrality. Motes are completely energy-autonomous in multi-hop WSAN scenario by eliminating the need of access to external power-grid for future cyber–physical system.',\n",

Our research leverages organizational information processing theory to explore the impact of three AI types – cognitive insights, process automation, and cognitive engagement – on manufacturers' resilience and performance. Our findings unveil that AI-driven process automation and cognitive engagement significantly influence both planned and adaptive resilience among manufacturers, while AI for cognitive insights predominantly elevates planned resilience without substantial effects on adaptive resilience. Moreover, our study establishes a positive link between planned and adaptive resilience and manufacturers' operational performance.

Such paradigm gives rise to the adoption of analytics and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) in mobile communications with the ease of collecting various measurements related to end-users and the network, which can be exposed towards consumers, including 3rd party applications. AI/ML may influence network planning and optimization considering the service life-cycle and introduce new operations provision, paving the way towards 6G. This article provides a survey on AI/ML considering the business, the fundamentals and algorithms across the radio, control, and management planes. It sheds light on the key technologies that assist the adoption of AI/ML in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks considering service request, reporting, data collection and distribution and it overviews the main AI/ML algorithms characterizing them into user-centric and network-centric.

       "  'abstract': 'Air pollution is at the center of pollution-control discussion due to the significant adverse health effects on individuals and the environment. Research has shown the association between unsafe environments and different sizes of particulate matter (PM), highlighting the importance of pollutant monitoring to mitigate its detrimental effect. By monitoring air quality with low-cost monitoring devices that collect massive observations, such as Air Box, a comprehensive collection of ground-level PM concentration is plausible due to the simplicity and low-cost, propelling applications in agriculture, aquaculture, and air quality, water resources, and disaster prevention. This paper aims to view IoT-based systems with low-cost microsensors at the sensor, network, and application levels, along with machine learning algorithms that improve sensor networks’ precision, providing better resolution. From the analysis at the three levels, we analyze current PM monitoring methods, including the use of sensors when collecting PM concentrations, demonstrate the use of IoT-based systems in PM monitoring and its challenges, and finally present the integration of AI and IoT (AIoT) in PM monitoring, indoor air quality control, and future directions. In addition, the inclusion of Taiwan as a site analysis was illustrated to show an example of AIoT in PM-control policy-making potential directions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding species distribution and canopy structure of mangrove forests is imperative for flora and fauna conservation in mangrove habitats. However, most mangrove studies focused on the top canopy layer without exploring the vertical structure of mangroves. This paper presents multi-layered mangrove mapping which considered both overstory and understory detection and species classification using multispectral WorldView-3 (WV-3) data, airborne hyperspectral images (HSI), and LiDAR point cloud. First, LiDAR returns were stratified into the overstory and understory by analyzing the profile of return height, which helped understand the vertical structure of the mangrove stands. Second, three classification algorithms Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were compared by applying WV-3, HSI, LiDAR data, and their combinations to map seven vegetative species. Feature selection was conducted to identify important features and the optimal feature size prior to classification tasks. The measured and estimated understory canopy heights reached a high correlation coefficient of 0.71, which demonstrated the effectiveness of using LiDAR data and the proposed procedure to stratify multi-layered canopies. The combined HSI and LiDAR data produced satisfactory results by the three classifiers with overall accuracy (OA) varying from 0.86 to 0.88. And the species was also accurately mapped by integrating WV-3 and LiDAR data using both RF and SVM algorithms with OA attaining between 0.84 and 0.86. The results of this study highlight that (1) LiDAR data provided superior information to map the vertical structure of multi-layered mangroves, which provided valuable information to classify single-layered and dual-layered Kandelia obovata with understory beneath; (2) the combination of spectral and LiDAR features improved mangrove species classification; (3) and species mapping results derived from combined datasets appeared to be more influential by LiDAR features when using RF and SVM, but spectral features played a more important role in CNN.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent times, the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including smart transportation, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart city, etc. generate a large volume of real-time data for decision making. In the past decades, real-time sensory data have been offloaded to centralized cloud servers for data analysis through a reliable communication channel. However, due to the long communication distance between end-users and centralized cloud servers, the chances of increasing network congestion, data loss, latency, and energy consumption are getting significantly higher. To address the challenges mentioned above, fog computing emerges in a distributed environment that extends the computation and storage facilities at the edge of the network. Compared to centralized cloud infrastructure, a distributed fog framework can support delay-sensitive IoT applications with minimum latency and energy consumption while analyzing the data using a set of resource-constraint fog/edge devices. Thus our survey covers the layered IoT architecture, evaluation metrics, and applications aspects of fog computing and its progress in the last four years. Furthermore, the layered architecture of the standard fog framework and different state-of-the-art techniques for utilizing computing resources of fog networks have been covered in this study. Moreover, we included an IoT use case scenario to demonstrate the fog data offloading and resource provisioning example in heterogeneous vehicular fog networks. Finally, we examine various challenges and potential solutions to establish interoperable communication and computation for next-generation IoT applications in fog networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The evolution of concrete materials faces challenges in meeting the mechanical demands of contemporary architectural structures due to the limitations of conventional concrete and the impracticalities of ultra-high-performance concrete. Addressing this, the exploration of Low-Carbon, High-Performance Cement-Based Composites (LCHPCC) emerges as a strategic avenue. This paper investigates diverse materials within the LCHPCC realm, emphasizing material selection and innovative processes to bolster performance and sustainability. The study delves into large-volume pozzolanic cementitious materials, including the limestone-calcined clay-cement (LC3) system, inert filler powders, and alkali-activated systems. It underscores critical considerations for optimizing powder material utilization in low-carbon methodologies. Furthermore, enhancing the aggregate system with low-carbon fine and coarse aggregates enhances the high-performance and low-carbon characteristics of LCHPCC. Incorporating recycled waste fibers significantly increases the mechanical properties of LCHPCC. Additionally, the integration of specific chemical additives and nanomaterials not only elevates performance but also broadens the application potential of LCHPCC. A life-cycle assessment analysis and practical validation case studies demonstrate the substantial advantages of LCHPCC over traditional concrete, emphasizing its sustainable attributes. This paper offers a balanced proposition for the ongoing development of low-carbon concrete materials, aligning with the principles of sustainable construction.',\n",

This can eventually lead to unexpected outcomes and undermine trust in such systems. Therefore it is crucial not only to develop effective and robust AI systems, but to make sure their internal processes are explainable and fair. Our goal in this chapter is to introduce the topic of designing assurance methods for AI systems with high-impact decisions using the example of the technology sector of the US economy.

OSFL revolutionizes the traditional Federated Learning (FL) workflow by condensing multiple iterative communication rounds into a single operation, thus significantly reducing energy consumption, communication overhead, and latency. This breakthrough is coupled with the strategic integration of generative learning techniques, ensuring robust data privacy while promoting efficient knowledge sharing among IoT devices. By curtailing resource utilization, OSFL aligns seamlessly with the vision of green and sustainable IoT, effectively extending device lifespans and mitigating their environmental footprint. Our research underscores the transformative potential of OSFL, poised to reshape the landscape of IoT applications across domains such as energy-efficient smart cities and groundbreaking healthcare solutions.

       "  'abstract': 'In the current global trend, financial organizations strive extensively towards smartening finance to derive the benefits of digitalization. In such an effort, Financial Technology (Fintech) involves usage of several contemporary disruptive technologies such as AI, 5G/6G, Blockchain, Metaverse, IoT, etc., in financial industry to add value to the customer services. By the inception of technology, several major financial services and processes such as lending, verification, fraud detection, quality maintenance, credit scoring, and many more will be simplified and augmented. However, there is a need for research and innovation of disruptive financial products and the enabling ecosystem of technologies. Consequently, several tech-giants have focused their attention on Fintech to introduce Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions. In this manuscript, firstly, we envision the future trends and driving applications of Fintech that would emerge during 2030. Further, we attempt to provide a high-level framework of the enablers of Fintech including IoT, 5G, Digital twins and Metaverse for certain use cases. In addition, we provide directions for future Fintech research while anticipating the challenges ahead.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The occurrence of heated and immature canola kernels caused by excessive drying and frost damage is undesired by grain buyers due to lower oil yield and diminished market value. The current grading process is visually examining each kernel's endosperm color and counting the damaged seeds. As this process is time-consuming, laborious, and prone to errors, this study proposes an automated grading technique based on object detection, multi-object tracking, and counting. The detection task was achieved via an improved YOLOv7 network (YOLOv7\\\\_ours) that was modified to increase its performance in accurately identifying small objects by adding two convolutional block attention modules in the neck region and decrease its computational complexity (cost) and size by substituting convolutional layers with ghost layers in all the Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks modules, and in the Spatial Pyramid Pooling Cross Stage Partial module present in YOLOv7. The weights of the trained network were fed to the ByteTrack multiple object tracker to track the detections frame-by-frame in a video feed. The unique identities generated by the tracker for each detected object of interest were then used to count the number of defects using a line cross algorithm. The mean average precision (mAP@0.5) obtained after training the YOLOv7\\\\_ours model was 1.02\\\\% better and its cost and size were 32.1\\\\% and 37.1\\\\% lower than the baseline YOLOv7 model. In a test video, the overall model achieved a multi-object tracking accuracy and counting accuracy of 84.8\\\\% and 93.9\\\\%, respectively. This three-stage model can be readily deployed in an edge device for accurate and real-time grading of canola kernels by grain buyers.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Massive developments in mobile wireless telecommunication networks have been made during the last few decades. At present, mobile users are getting familiar with the latest 5G networks, and the discussion for the next generation of Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks has already been initiated. It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment. To address the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on privacy-related aspects of B5G/6G networks. First, it discusses a taxonomy of different privacy perspectives. Based on the taxonomy, the paper then conceptualizes a set of challenges that appear as barriers to reach privacy preservation. Next, this work provides a set of solutions applicable to the proposed architecture of B5G/6G networks to mitigate the challenges. It also provides an overview of standardization initiatives for privacy preservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a roadmap of future directions, which will be an arena for new research towards privacy-enhanced B5G/6G networks. This work provides a basis for privacy aspects that will significantly impact peoples’ daily lives when using these future networks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Effective use of GPS and mobile networks for localisation in rangeland areas is constrained by their high power consumption and high deployment costs. Long-range (LoRa), a low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technology, can be employed to mitigate these challenges. In contrast to prior research where the prevalent approaches entail multiple gateways. This work proposes a valuable methodology focused on a single mobile LoRa gateway for localisation. A particle filtering and machine learning-based pipeline is employed to map the distance between a target node and the gateway from the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Particle filtering is used to reduce the impact of noise on the RSSI values. Then, several machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines, random forest, and k-nearest neighbour, are used on the RSSI values to estimate the distance. The estimated distance is then used for tracking using a centroid pseudo-trilateration method. The proposed method was tested in a real-world semi-line-of-sight setting, using three datasets generated by LoRaWAN-specified hardware components and a server. Two forms of experiments were performed: active searching and passive monitoring. We propose an iterative estimation process to address the dilution of precision caused by the initial positions of the gateway required for active searching applications. The results show that active searching typically requires 2 to 3 hops to reach a target node. The accuracy of passive monitoring depends on the proximity of the gateway, which varies from 20 m to 170 m. This proposed approach has the potential to open the way for localising, tracking, or monitoring target objects within sparsely populated rangeland areas, even when resources are severely constrained.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Most of current computer vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) perform detection and tracking of objects quite successfully under regular conditions. However, under adverse weather and changing lighting conditions, and in complex situations with many overlapping objects, these systems are not completely reliable. The spectral reflectance of the different objects in a driving scene beyond the visible spectrum can offer additional information to increase the reliability of these systems, especially under challenging driving conditions. Furthermore, this information may be significant enough to develop vision systems that allow for a better understanding and interpretation of the whole driving scene. In this work we explore the use of snapshot, video-rate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cameras in ADAS on the assumption that the near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance of different materials can help to better segment the objects in real driving scenarios. To do this, we have used the HSI-Drive 1.1 dataset to perform various experiments on spectral classification algorithms. However, the information retrieval of hyperspectral recordings in natural outdoor scenarios is challenging, mainly because of deficient color constancy and other inherent shortcomings of current snapshot HSI technology, which poses some limitations to the development of pure spectral classifiers. In consequence, in this work we analyze to what extent the spatial features codified by standard, tiny fully convolutional network (FCN) models can improve the performance of HSI segmentation systems for ADAS applications. In order to be realistic from an engineering viewpoint, this research is focused on the development of a feasible HSI segmentation system for ADAS, which implies considering implementation constraints and latency specifications throughout the algorithmic development process. For this reason, it is of particular importance to include the study of the raw image preprocessing stage into the data processing pipeline. Accordingly, this paper describes the development and deployment of a complete machine learning-based HSI segmentation system for ADAS, including the characterization of its performance on different embedded computing platforms, including a single board computer, an embedded GPU SoC and a programmable system on chip (PSoC) with embedded FPGA. We verify the superiority of the FPGA-PSoC over the GPU-SoC in terms of energy consumption and, particularly, processing latency, and demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve segmentation speeds within the range of ADAS industry specifications using standard development tools.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'While 5G is at the early deployment state around the globe, the research and industrial communities have already started concentrating their efforts on formulating the overall 6G vision comprising requirements, key enabling technologies, performance indicators, and applications. Following the trend, it is evident that 6G will emerge as highly softwarized and open networks allowing the participation of multiple stakeholders. This undoubtedly will make 6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks. However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues, a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus, we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements. Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions.

       "  'abstract': 'High-precision prediction of onshore and offshore wind power generation (O-OWPG) provides valuable reference for maximizing ecological-economic benefits. From a perspective of double nonlinearity, a flexible fractional grey Bernoulli model, namely VTFNGBM(1,1), is proposed, to accurately describe different development stages of O-OWPG series. Core innovations are summarized below. Specifically, a variable-weight full information time power term with adjustable moderating effect is innovatively designed to describe real evolution process. By introducing the dynamic adaptation mechanism to expand grey action, the generalized time response function is further derived to strengthen the flexibility. Additionally, a comprehensive verification and optimization system for accuracy of VTFNGBM(1,1) is designed, which provides a substantial scheme to precision improvement. It includes the parameter optimization of Marine Predator Algorithm and its robustness test by Monte Carlo simulation-kernel density estimation. Importantly, grey-statistic-machine learning benchmark models are compared to validate the effectiveness of VTFNGBM(1,1) model. The O-OWPG in China (rising), Denmark (steady), and the UK (fluctuating) are employed to explore their potential and differences in national dimension. Furthermore, application in regional dimension ensures the reliability of the proposed model. Empirical results demonstrate that the forecasting capacity of VTFNGBM(1,1) model is significantly ascendant in all cases. Forecast results for 2022–2025 show that offshore WPG in China and Denmark emerge a stronger rising potential. However, the UK basically forms a 0.48:0.52 onshore and offshore wind power supply pattern.',\n",

From the analysis, we can infer that, in the smart city, latency is the most usable parameter, i.e., 77\\\\%. In contrast, in Healthcare 4.0, equal importance is given to latency and network bandwidth, which is 50\\\\%. Also, in Industry 4.0, scalability is the most opted performance parameter by the researchers, which is 100\\\\%. The smart grid application uses latency and delay are the most valuable parameters, i.e., 60\\\\%.',\n",

This paper first introduces the background of the logistics and supply chain industry, the DT and its potential benefits, and the motivations and scope of this research. The literature review indicates research and practice gaps and needs that motivate proposing a new conceptual DT framework for LSCS. As each element of the new framework has different requirements and goals, it initiates new research opportunities and creates practical implementation challenges. As such, the future of DT computation involves advanced analytics and modeling techniques to address the new agenda’s requirements.

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches nowadays have gained remarkable success in single-modality-dominated remote sensing (RS) applications, especially with an emphasis on individual urban environments (e.g., single cities or regions). Yet these AI models tend to meet the performance bottleneck in the case studies across cities or regions, due to the lack of diverse RS information and cutting-edge solutions with high generalization ability. To this end, we build a new set of multimodal remote sensing benchmark datasets (including hyperspectral, multispectral, SAR) for the study purpose of the cross-city semantic segmentation task (called C2Seg dataset), which consists of two cross-city scenes, i.e., Berlin-Augsburg (in Germany) and Beijing-Wuhan (in China). Beyond the single city, we propose a high-resolution domain adaptation network, HighDAN for short, to promote the AI model's generalization ability from the multi-city environments. HighDAN is capable of retaining the spatially topological structure of the studied urban scene well in a parallel high-to-low resolution fusion fashion but also closing the gap derived from enormous differences of RS image representations between different cities by means of adversarial learning. In addition, the Dice loss is considered in HighDAN to alleviate the class imbalance issue caused by factors across cities. Extensive experiments conducted on the C2Seg dataset show the superiority of our HighDAN in terms of segmentation performance and generalization ability, compared to state-of-the-art competitors. The C2Seg dataset and the semantic segmentation toolbox (involving the proposed HighDAN) will be available publicly at https://github.com/danfenghong/RSE\\\\_Cross-city.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The circular supply chain (CSC) paradigm advocates a shift in business practices from linear to circular models for the planet’s sustainability. CSC involves recovery processes that result in capturing additional value and reduction of carbon footprints in the supply chain. Industry 5.0 (I5.0) revolution involves a network of connected devices and systems across the supply chain to facilitate intelligent manufacturing as per customer-specific requirements. It can be an enabling tool for achieving sustainability via a circular economy. In the existing literature, there is an absence of a framework connecting the drivers of I5.0 and CSC. The present study identifies 16 potential drivers in the context of achieving I5.0 and CSC synergy from the literature review and in consultation with industry professionals and practitioners. To identify the criticality strength of drivers, a mixed model is constructed using the modified Total Interpretive Structure Model (m-TISM) and the Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC). The m-TISM arranges the binary interactions between the drivers, while MICMAC arranges the precise evaluations specific to the dependence and driving power of the drivers. The exercise results in a framework for handling efficiently the drivers of I5.0 and CSC to attain sustainable development. The results from the study reflect that ‘Management support for CSC and I5.0 transformation’ and ‘Organization readiness and expectation in the transformation to CSC and I5.0′ are the drivers with maximum driving power and hence should be given high priority in designing the implementation plan. Also, the driving element ‘Attitudinal transition of consumers towards CSC and I5.0 models’ is among the top-level drivers in the analysis, indicating the importance of creating awareness and attitude building in realizing this business process change. In the current global business environment of high competition and sustainability pressure, the study provides guidelines to company directors and supply chain strategists in achieving efficiency and sustainability objectives via I5.0 and CSC approaches. The proposed framework could also assist the various government and industry associations in formulating policies for I5.0, CSC and sustainable development.',\n",

ChatGPT, a virtual social robot, has captured significant attention from the mass media and academic practitioners alike since its release in November 2022. This attention arises from its remarkable capabilities, as well as potential challenges it poses to society and various business sectors. In light of these developments, we developed a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and a consumer value typology centred around consumer experiences to examine the influence of experiential factors on the intention to use ChatGPT and subsequently collaborating with it for co-creating content among business managers. To test this model, we conducted a survey of 195 business managers in the UK and employed partial PLS-structural equation modelling for analysis. Our findings indicate that the efficiency, excellence, meaningfulness of recommendations, and conversational ability of ChatGPT will influence the behavioural intention to use it during the priori acceptance stage. Based on these findings, we suggest that organisations should thoughtfully consider and strategize the deployment of ChatGPT applications to ensure their acceptance, eventual adoption, and subsequent collaboration between ChatGPT and managers for content creation or problem-solving.',\n",

However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing study investigates the new trends of ransomware tactics and techniques and provides a comprehensive analysis of ransomware attacks and their detection techniques for IIoT systems. Therefore, this paper investigates this attack and its associated detection techniques in IIoT systems in various aspects, including recent ransomware tactics, types, infected operating systems, and platforms. Specifically, we initially discuss the evolution of the IIoT system and its common architecture. Then, we provide an in-depth examination of the development of ransomware attacks and their constituent blocks, outline recent tactics and types of ransomware, and provide an extensive overview of the latest research on detection models. We also summarize numerous significant issues that have yet to be addressed and require further research.

These connected devices generate and transmit a vast amount of data about the city’s environment, traffic, and any other aspects that define the interaction between the cities and their citizens. The appearance and rising penetration of new computing paradigms and low-power wireless area network technologies are turning traditional cloud architectures that gather data from Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or GSM/LTE connected devices into more distributed platforms with computation at different network layers. At the same time, low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology has opened a whole new world of opportunities in the IoT. More concretely, LPWAN solutions that operate on unlicensed radio bands have enabled low-power and long-distance communication to industry, researchers, public organizations, and individuals equally. Together with these, the increasing penetration of the edge and fog computing paradigms is allowing for smarter IoT solutions that do not necessarily rely on cloud servers. In this chapter, we present a hybrid edge-fog-cloud computing architecture for monitoring environment parameters and traffic flow in a city with a very small footprint in terms of installed infrastructure. In particular, we put an emphasis on traffic monitoring and propose a lightweight image processing algorithm that estimates traffic density.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Urban forestry is a challenging task in densely populated cities. Tree failure accidents often induce casualties and property damage that should be prevented in advance. In light of such a need, an AI-IoT integrated framework for tree tilt monitoring is proposed in this study, and consists of three stages: (I) data collection through a LoRaWAN-based IoT tree monitoring system, called Internet of Tree Things (IoTT) and data processing; (II) AI-enabled data analytics (anomaly detection); and (III) diagnosis of tree stability. With the tree tilt data wirelessly captured by the IoTT, associated anomalies in the measurement can then be automatically detected by the vanilla LSTM model, if the prediction error exceeds the threshold for the normal responses. A four-level likelihood of tree failure ratings based on the number of anomalies detected within a time-window is introduced accordingly. The proposed framework is further validated using data from five failure trees in Hong Kong, which had been constantly monitored lasting from ∼1 month to ∼22 months before their final failure during typhoons. The resultant lead time for categorizing these trees into the lowest level of the failure likelihood ranged from ∼8 hrs to ∼35 hrs and that into the highest level of the failure likelihood was from ∼1 hr to ∼30 hrs. By comparing the tree tilt angles in response to similar weather conditions, together with the mechanical responses, such as elastic or elastoplastic responses revealed in the temporal wind tipping curves in the subsequent inclement weather events, long-term tree stability trends can be examined with biomechanical evidence and can complement visual tree inspection in which the early signs of tree failure might be missed between inspections. By including the knowledge and judgement of arborists in the decision loop, the framework provides an evidence-based, objective, and effective approach to enhance urban forestry safety.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays, increasing urbanization has necessitated the social, environmental, and economic development of cities to enhance the Quality of Life (QoL) significantly and introduces the “Smart City” concept. It integrates Information and Communication Tools (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to resolve urban challenges. The key goal is to make the most acceptable use of available resources and technologies to develop smart cities. An IoT-enabled application plays a crucial role here, but it has various security, privacy, latency, and reliability issues with a single-point-of-failure problem. The evolving technology blockchain can handle the aforementioned security and privacy issues and provide high-quality services due to several features like transparency, trust-free, decentralization, immutability, and others. The 6G communication network takes care of latency and reliability issues in the smart city with their unique characteristics such as latency (10–100 μs) and reliability (99.99999\\\\%). Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review for blockchain technology and IoT together functional to smart cities. First, state-of-art-the works and contextual information are introduced. Then, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized architecture for IoT-integrated smart cities covering different application perspectives, such as smart grid, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), and healthcare 5.0 underlying 6G communication networks. Next, we describe the challenges of the proposed architecture respective to each application, as mentioned above. Finally, we collated the open research issues and future direction to efficiently integrate blockchain into IoT-envisioned smart cities.',\n",

Thus, we tried to predict the yield by combining an AI technique for receptacle detection in images and statistical analysis on the relationship between the number of receptacles detected and the strawberry yield over a period of time. Five major cultivars were cultivated to consider the cultivar characteristics and environmental factors for two years were collected to consider the climate difference. Faster R–CNN based object detector was used to estimate the number of receptacles per strawberry plant in given two-dimensional images, which achieved a mAP of 0.6587 for our dataset. However, not all receptacles appear on the two-dimensional images, and Bayesian analysis was used to model the uncertainty associated with the number of receptacles missed by the AI. After estimating the probability of fruiting per receptacle, prediction models for the total strawberry yield at the end of harvest season were evaluated. Even though the detection accuracy was not perfect, the results indicated that counting the receptacles by object detection and estimating the probability of fruiting per receptacle by Bayesian modeling are more useful for predicting the total yield per plant than knowing its cumulative yield during the first month.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The internet of things (IoT) has expanded the reachability of pervasive applications in different domains. Smart healthcare is one such area where IoT-based approaches have been successfully demonstrated in the recent past. However, issues related to the scaling of large ad hoc elements are still a major challenge. Medical delivery drones are a new variant of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to pave a holistic orientation into the smart health service paradigm. Lack of augmentation aware notions has resisted the realization of an actual intervention of IoT-based medical delivery via UAVs. Proper architectural frameworks and models are needed to efficiently integrate IoT with medical delivery drones. However, major security drawbacks should be investigated a priori to imply the health delivery services in coming days. We can use blockchain-centric approaches to fill this gap in the IoT-based medical delivery drone ecosystem. In this chapter, we first present details about drone suppliers and perform a comparative analysis of such drones for medical delivery. Secondly, we present a state of the art on blockchain-assisted, IoT-based, drone-centric, medical delivery. Finally, we depict some key challenges associated with existing drone delivery mechanisms and prescribe future directions. We conclude that drones have huge potential to revolutionize the status of medical delivery with support from the IoT and blockchain platforms. Overall, the medical delivery domain is envisaged to augment existing medical care with enriched security.',\n",

Due to lower immunity, decreased mobility, and a shortage in healthcare facilities and clinical staff, these populations face severe health challenges, including a limited ability to live independently. Advanced technological solutions can be used to support healthy and independent living, improving the quality of life of individuals. In this paper, we explore the emerging but underexplored field of internet of robotic things (IoRT) for independent living support. IoRT employs various on-body, off-body and ambient sensors to get real-time information from individuals, with robotic systems used to provide assistance with daily activities, critical and emergency events. We find that most of the previous IoRT works monitor the people offline and store their sensory data for later analysis instead of online processing and offering real-time assistance.

An explosion of smart devices and technologies has allowed mankind to be in constant communication anywhere and anytime. IoT trend has created a sub-segment of the IoT market known as the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) or Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 dubbed I4.0 marks the fourth in the Industrial Revolution that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation, autonomy, machine learning, and real-time data. By 2020, it is estimated that over 30 billion of the world's devices will be connected in some way—which is 20 billion more devices than today! The consistent capturing and transmitting of data among machines provide manufacturing companies with many growth opportunities. The IIoT is expected to transform how we live, work and play. The number one challenge faced by the Industrial IoT is security and privacy. If we cannot alleviate many of the security and privacy issues that impact the Industrial IoT, we will not be able to achieve its full potential. IoT and the trend toward greater connectivity means more data gathered from more places, in real time, to enable real-time decisions and increase revenue, productivity, and efficiency.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has vast potential in marketing. It aids in proliferating information and data sources, improving software's data management capabilities, and designing intricate and advanced algorithms. AI is changing the way brands and users interact with one another. The application of this technology is highly dependent on the nature of the website and the type of business. Marketers can now focus more on the customer and meet their needs in real time. By using AI, they can quickly determine what content to target customers and which channel to employ at what moment, thanks to the data collected and generated by its algorithms. Users feel at ease and are more inclined to buy what is offered when AI is used to personalise their experiences. AI tools can also be used to analyse the performance of a competitor's campaigns and reveal their customers' expectations. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to analyse and interpret data without being explicitly programmed. Furthermore, ML assists humans in solving problems efficiently. The algorithm learns and improves performance and accuracy as more data is fed into the algorithm. For this research, relevant articles on AI in marketing are identified from Scopus, Google scholar, researchGate and other platforms. Then these articles were read, and the theme of the paper was developed. This paper attempts to review the role of AI in marketing. The specific applications of AI in various marketing segments and their transformations for marketing sectors are examined. Finally, critical applications of AI for marketing are recognised and analysed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Intelligent harvesting can greatly reduce the manual labor for fruit harvesting and is one of the main application areas of intelligent agricultural machinery. Smart edge sensors must detect the growth status of tomatoes and strawberries in real-time for intelligent harvesting to be possible. Due to edge devices' relatively low image processing power, it remains challenging to implement deep learning algorithms for real-time detection in field applications. Therefore, scholars are strongly interested in utilizing computationally small, accurate, and quick models for edge harvesting machinery. In this research, we propose RTFD, a lightweight algorithm for edge CPU devices that detects fruit. Based on the PicoDet-S model, RTFD optimizes the efficiency of real-time detection for edge CPU computing devices by enhancing the model's structure, loss function and activation function. The experimental results demonstrate that the mAP of RTFD for tomato and strawberry datasets at various growth phases is 0.78 and 0.96, respectively, with a computational effort of 1.44 GFLOPs. RTFD improves mAP by 1.9\\\\% and 2.3\\\\% on the tomato and strawberry datasets, respectively, with minimal loss in computation and model parameters, making it more suitable for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, we proposed an approach for 8-bit quantization-aware training of the Conv2D and Linear layers of the model for improved edge deployment. This approach quantizes 32-bit floating-point values in the Conv2D and Linear layers into 8-bit integers, thereby reducing the model's size and accelerating detection speed. The testing findings indicate that the quantized RTFD model has a size of 1.33 MB and a CPU detection speed of around 11 FPS. Using the quantified trained model, we developed the Android application RTFD-CPU to evaluate the model's performance in test scenarios. RTFD-CPU was assessed on the smartphone Redmi K30pro (Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 CPU and 8 GB of RAM) with a detection speed of 19 FPS utilizing only the CPU. In summary, the proposed RTFD has great potential for intelligent picking machines, and the concept of redesigning the model structure, loss function, and activation function, as well as training by quantization to speed up the detection of deep neural networks, is anticipated to be successfully implemented in edge computing.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB) are damaging to ecosystem functions and pose challenges to environmental and fisheries management. The key to HAB management and understanding the complex algal growth dynamics is the development of robust systems for real-time monitoring of algae populations and species. Previous algae classification studies mainly rely on the combination of an in-situ imaging flow cytometer and an off-site lab-based algae classification model such as Random Forest (RF) for the analysis of high-throughput images. An on-site AI algae monitoring system on top of an edge AI chip embedded with the proposed Algal Morphology Deep Neural Network (AMDNN) model is developed to achieve real-time algae species classification and HAB prediction. Based on a detailed examination of real-world algae images, dataset augmentation is first performed: consisting of orientation, flipping, blurring, and Resizing with Aspect ratio Preserved (RAP). The dataset augmentation is shown to significantly improve classification performance which is superior to that of the competitive RF model. And the attention heatmaps show that for relatively regular-shaped algal species (e.g., Vicicitus), the model weights the color and texture information heavily; while the shape-related features are more important for complex-shaped algae (e.g., Chaetoceros). The AMDNN is tested on a dataset of 11,250 algae images containing the 25 most common HAB classes in Hong Kong subtropical waters with 99.87\\\\% test accuracy. Based on the fast and accurate algae classification, the AI-chip-based on-site system is applied to a one-month dataset in February 2020; the predicted trends of total cell counts and targeted HAB species counts are in good agreement with observations. The proposed edge AI algae monitoring system provides a platform for the development of practical HAB early warning systems that can effectively support environmental risk and fisheries management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the past decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes essential in consumer and industrial applications. The accessibility of high bandwidth Internet connection particularly with the arrival of robust 5G networks rises to innovative IoT solutions such as smart city, automobiles, industry 4.0, etc. IoT analytics represents edge computing as a term commonly employed for defining intelligent computational resources placed closer to the source of data generation. Despite the benefits of the IoT edge systems, security and energy efficiency remains major challenging issues. With this motivation, this paper presents an energy-efficient clustering based secure data transmission protocol (EEC-SDTP) for Intelligent IoT Edge systems. The goal of the EEC-SDTP technique is to select an appropriate set of cluster heads (CHs) and optimally secure routes for data transmission in the network. The proposed model involves oppositional chaos game optimization-based clustering (OCGOC) technique for proper CH selection and cluster construction. Besides, a trust-based model is designed to determine the trustworthiness of the node in the IoT edge systems. The proposed OCGOC technique derives a fitness function utilizing 3 input parameters like trust level, distance to neighbors, and energy. Finally, a trust-based secure routing protocol using the quantum sand piper optimization (SRP-QSPO) technique is employed to derive routes for secure data transmission. For examining the better efficiency of the proposed EEC-SDTP algorithm, an extensive group of experimentations were performed and the outcomes are investigated under several performance measures. The experimental outcomes highlighted the improved efficiency of the proposed method over the other related techniques.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) allows communication between devices, things, and any digital assets that send and receive data over a network without requiring interaction with a human. The main characteristic of IoT is the enormous quantity of data created by end-user’s devices that needs to be processed in a short time in the cloud. The current cloud-computing concept is not efficient to analyze very large data in a very short time and satisfy the users’ requirements. Analyzing the enormous quantity of data by the cloud will take a lot of time, which affects the quality of service (QoS) and negatively influences the IoT applications and the overall network performance. To overcome such challenges, a new architecture called edge computing — that allows to decentralize the process of data from the cloud to the network edge has been proposed to solve the problems occurred by using the cloud computing approach. Furthermore, edge computing supports IoT applications that require a short response time and consequently enhances the consumption of energy, resource utilization, etc. Motivated by the extensive research efforts in the edge computing and IoT applications, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review of edge and fog computing research in the IoT. We investigate the role of cloud, fog, and edge computing in the IoT environment. Subsequently, we cover in detail, different IoT use cases with edge and fog computing, the task scheduling in edge computing, the merger of software-defined networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) with edge computing, security and privacy efforts. Furthermore, the Blockchain in edge computing. Finally, we identify open research challenges and highlight future research directions.',\n",

To achieve this, a much better adaptable communication network architecture is required, one that is exceptionally intelligent and capable of providing hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications. These needs of the next-generation wireless communication systems are expected to be met by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies. The standardization process for fifth-generation is now complete, and the worldwide installation has begun. To keep cellular networks competitive, a collaboration between industry and academics has already commenced in designing the next phase called “6G” in communication networks. It provides the groundwork for layering the communication demands arising in the 2030s. 6G perception, services, technology, and standardization are all hot topics in academics and industries. In pursuit of this ambition, this paper outlines the most prospective avenues of 6G research from current literature. In this investigation, the paper highly focuses on state-of-art driving factors and technological developments propelling the 6G revolution. In this study, emerging applications and requirements are also discussed in depth. Then, to provide a perspective on the global aspect of 6G development, the frameworks for existing and ongoing research projects and activities, including standardization efforts, are reviewed.

Within agriculture, which is the focus of this paper, AI is working with converging technologies, particularly data optimization, to add value along the entire agricultural value chain, including procurement, farm automation, and market access. Our key takeaway is that, despite the promising opportunities for development, there are actual and potential challenges that African countries need to consider in deciding whether to scale up or down the application of AI in agriculture. Input from African innovators, policymakers, and academics is essential to ensure that AI solutions are aligned with African needs and priorities.

       "  'abstract': 'Computer vision is a key technique to make agricultural machinery smart. Deep neural network has achieved great success in computer vision. How to use it at a small size, low cost, low power consumption device with high accuracy and speed on strawberry harvesting machinery has drawn much research attention. Since the infield situation has reduced number of objects and that they are easier to be distinguished from the background compared to other computer vision datasets, the huge neural network structure can be simplified in order to speed up the detection inference without penalizing the detection accuracy. In this research, a new deep neural network called RTSD-Net is proposed based on stat-of-art light-weighted YOLOv4-tiny with reduced layers and modified structure for real-time strawberry detection under infield condition. The original CSPNet was replaced by 2 types of CSPNet designed with reduced parameters and a simplified structure and 4 new network structures are designed by combining these 2 types. The performances of the 4 networks were evaluated. It was observed that the number of parameters of these 4 networks and the detection speed of the model is negatively correlated. Simplified structure and reduced parameters can contribute to faster operational speed. The last one was selected and named as RTSD-Net. Comparing with YOLOv4 tiny, the accuracy of RTSD-Net is only reduced by 0.62\\\\% but the speed is increased by 25FPS, which is 25.93\\\\% higher than that of YOLOv4-tiny. Embedded system Jetson Nano was selected as the evaluation platform to evaluate the RTSD-Net’s performance for edge computing. The original Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) model was loaded on Jetson Nano and the speed of RTSD-Net was 13.1FPS, which is 19.0\\\\% higher than that of YOLOv4-tiny. After speeded up by TensorRT method, the transformed model reached 25.20fps, which is twice as fast as the ONNX model, and 15\\\\% faster than the YOLOv4-tiny model. After speeding up, the efficiency of RTSD-Net is enough for computer vision based strawberry detection and harvesting. In summary, the proposed RTSD-Net has good potential in smart strawberry harvesting machinery and the idea of redesigning neural structure and reducing parameters to speed up the detection rate of deep neural network is expected to have good application in edge computing.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In general, agriculture plays a crucial role in human survival as a primary source of food, alongside other sources such as fishing. Unfortunately, global warming and other environmental issues, particularly in less privileged nations, hamper the Agricultural sector. It is estimated that a range of 720 to 811 million individuals experienced food insecurity. Today's agriculture faced significant difficulties and obstacles, as do the surveillance and monitoring systems (climate, energy, water, fields, works, cost, fertilizers, diseases, etc.). The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the susceptibilities and insufficiencies inherent in worldwide food systems. Current agricultural practices tend to prioritize productivity and profitability over environmental conservation and long-term sustainability. To establish sustainable agriculture capable of meeting the needs of a projected ten billion people in the next 30 years, substantial structural and automation changes are required. However, these obstacles can be overcome by employing smart technologies and advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agricultural operations. AI is believed to contribute to global sustainability goals in multiple sectors, particularly in the incorporation of renewable energy. It is anticipated that AI will revitalize both existing and new agricultural fields by retrofitting, installing and integrating automatic devices and instruments. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most promising and novel applications of AI in the agriculture industry. Furthermore, the role of AI in the transition to sustainability and precision agriculture is investigated.\",\n",

But, by providing power within the networks, it may be susceptible to attacks such as eavesdropping, data manipulation, or denial of service, leading to issues like leakage of confidential, sensitive information, and energy scarcity. Therefore, it is important to implement appropriate security measures to protect the data and devices that use energy harvested from ambient sources. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the current and future developments of security for EH systems that used artificial intelligence(AI) approaches. Furthermore, we highlight the application of AI approaches such as machine learning (ML) and federated learning (FL) in the security of EH systems. Then, we discuss the security techniques that are used in the EH literature, including cryptography techniques, physical-layer security schemes, blockchain, and FL.

       "  'abstract': 'The challenges of urbanization, land degradation, water scarcity, and climate change are threatening agricultural systems and food security. Therefore, it is essential to manage land and water resources sustainably to improve productivity and address these challenges. Digital agriculture, which involves the use of smart systems and advanced farming practices incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, can provide solutions for sustainable agriculture and climate change adaptation. This study aims to fill the research gap by understanding the recent pulse and current trends of significant works published on AI and IoT-assisted land and water management (LWM) research. A bibliometric analysis of 436 English language articles published over the last three decades (1991–2021) was conducted. The study revealed a significant shift in research trends in 2010, with over 60 AI techniques utilized under different AI and IoT frameworks for LWM. The highly adopted AI techniques include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN—9.85\\\\%), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS —5.98\\\\%), Support Vector Regression (SVR—3.87\\\\%), Random Forest (RF—3.16\\\\%),\\u200b and Multilayer Perceptron-ANN (MLP-ANN—2.81\\\\%). China, India, Iran, Australia, and the USA were identified as pioneers in the field, while Italy, Spain, and Saudi Arabia showed potential as emerging countries but with low collaboration links. The study also discussed the current limitations and challenges of AI and IoT technologies. Future research focus areas for AI and IoT were identified, and it was recommended to conduct comparative evaluations of AI techniques to determine the most effective approach for specific LWM domains.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) totally revolutionized the way we interact with the world providing useful services that can support the human being in many aspects of his life. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another important player for bringing intelligence to CPS and allows the realization of Intelligent Cyber Physical Systems where smart applications can run. However, the constrained hardware of these devices in terms of memory and computing power makes challenging the deployment and execution of powerful algorithms (e.g., deep neural networks). To address this problem, modern solutions involve the use of compression techniques to reduce the memory footprint of deep learning models while saving the accuracy performance. The proposed work focuses on plant disease detection which represents one of the biggest challenges in smart agriculture; in such a context, the possibility to perform a timely diagnosis on crops suspected to be infected can avoid the spread of diseases, thus saving a lot of time and money during the plantation works. In this paper, we realized an intelligent CPS on top of which we implemented an AI application, called Deep Leaf that exploits Convolutional Neural Networks to detect the main biotic stresses affecting crops. To meet the hardware requirements of the Edge device running our application, we propose a novel dynamic compression algorithm based on K-Means for the reduction of models footprint. Experimental results show that our detector is able to correctly classify the plant health condition with an accuracy of 95\\\\% and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed compression algorithm which is able to maintain the same accuracy of the original 32 bit float model, with an overall memory size reduction of about 85.2\\\\%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A number of countries have adopted national policies and directives to balance the advantages and disadvantages of innovative technologies. The purpose of this paper is to identify the most prominent topics addressed by national AI policies, as well as their relative importance across nations. This paper integrates the results of a topic modeling analysis of 30 national AI policies with a qualitative content analysis of the policies. Based on this analysis, fourteen main common themes have been identified among national AI policies, which predominantly relate to educational, technological, government, ethical/legal, and social good concerns. Following this, we conducted a co-occurrence analysis of topics across countries to determine the extent of topic prioritization in each country. In this investigation, several marginalized AI policy topics were also identified. In general, the challenges and concerns of the majority of policies pertain to education, technology, and the government. Governments refer to real-world projects and investments in AI technologies without developing shared digital governance platforms that promote responsible and sustainable AI among technology titans and mitigate the negative effects of surveillance capitalism. Although governments acknowledge the ethical and legal aspects of AI development and frequently cite the GDPR, they limit their discussion to the data level, particularly data sharing, and marginalize ethical algorithms and other phases of data and AI management and design. In addition, government policies marginalize AI startups and the API economy, even though they play a crucial role in fostering the AI ecosystem. The paper contributes to the existing literature on AI policy and will serve as a guide for AI policymakers to help them better understand the topical similarities across countries and the neglected or marginalized challenges that require further attention.',\n",

Although these paradigms can partially address those challenges, their performance can still be affected by various issues, such as faults or network inefficiencies. To establish efficient network infrastructures for these paradigms, Network Management and Orchestration (NMO) techniques are introduced to improve various aspects of networking e.g., Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning, resource management, task allocation, and many others. Therefore, NMO primarily uses various methods like statistical models, heuristic techniques or Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate networking decision-making. In this study, we investigate NMO issues, related orchestration challenges and the usage of Machine Learning (ML) techniques as a sub-field of AI for NMO purposes. The focus rests on new Edge-based networking and computing paradigms that employ resource-constraint devices to perform different tasks in environments like Extreme Edge, Cloud-of-Things (CoT) or Mist. We provide a comprehensive survey including a state-of-the-art review, research challenges and future directions.

       "  'abstract': 'In this study, an algorithm is implemented with a computer vision model to detect and classify coffee fruits and map the fruits maturation stage during harvest. The main contribution of this study is with respect to the assignment of geographic coordinates to each frame, which enables the mapping of detection summaries across coffee rows. The model used to detect and classify coffee fruits was implemented using the Darknet, an open source framework for neural networks written in C. The coffee fruits detection and classification were performed using the object detection system named YOLOv3-tiny. For this study, 90 videos were recorded at the end of the discharge conveyor of a coffee harvester during the 2020 harvest of arabica coffee (Catuaí 144) at a commercial area in the region of Patos de Minas, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The model performance peaked around the 3300th iteration when considering an image input resolution of 800 × 800 pixels. The model presented an mAP of 84\\\\%, F1-Score of 82\\\\%, precision of 83\\\\%, and recall of 82\\\\% for the validation set. The average precision for the classes of unripe, ripe, and overripe coffee fruits was 86\\\\%, 85\\\\%, and 80\\\\%, respectively. As the algorithm enabled the detection and classification in videos collected during the harvest, it was possible to map the qualitative attributes regarding the coffee maturation stage along the crop lines. These attribute maps provide managers important spatial information for the application of precision agriculture techniques in crop management. Additionally, this study should incentive future research to customize the deep learning model for certain tasks in agriculture and precision agriculture.',\n",

The integration of artificial intelligence in agriculture has witnessed a significant uptick in recent years. Therefore, comprehensive understanding of these techniques is needed to broaden its application in agri-food supply chain. In this review, we explored cutting-edge artificial intelligence methodologies with a focus on machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. The application of artificial intelligence in agri-food industry and their quality assurance throughout the production process is thoroughly discussed with an emphasis on the current scientific knowledge and future perspective. Artificial intelligence has played a significant role in transforming agri-food systems by enhancing efficiency, sustainability, and productivity. Many food industries are implementing the artificial intelligence in modelling, prediction, control tool, sensory evaluation, quality control, and tackling complicated challenges in food processing. Similarly, artificial intelligence applied in agriculture to improve the entire farming process, such as crop yield optimization, use of herbicides, weeds identification, and harvesting of fruits.

       "  'abstract': 'Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) lays a new paradigm for the concept of Industry 4.0 and paves an insight for new industrial era. Nowadays smart machines and smart factories use machine learning/deep learning based models for incurring intelligence. However, storing and communicating the data to the cloud and end device leads to issues in preserving privacy. In order to address this issue, Federated Learning (FL) technology is implemented in IIoT by the researchers nowadays to provide safe, accurate, robust and unbiased models. Integrating FL in IIoT ensures that no local sensitive data is exchanged, as the distribution of learning models over the edge devices has become more common with FL. Therefore, only the encrypted notifications and parameters are communicated to the central server. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on integrating FL with IIoT in terms of privacy, resource and data management. The survey starts by articulating IIoT characteristics and fundamentals of distributed machine learning and FL. The motivation behind integrating IIoT and FL for achieving data privacy preservation and on-device learning are summarized. Then we discuss the potential of using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and blockchain techniques for FL in secure IIoT. Further we analyze and summarize several ways to handle the heterogeneous and huge data. Comprehensive background on data and resource management are then presented, followed by applications of IIoT with FL in automotive, robotics, agriculture, energy, and healthcare industries. Finally, we shed light on challenges, some possible solutions and potential directions for future research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Overcoming population growth dilemma with less resources of soil and water, the irrigated agriculture allows us to increase the yield and the production of several crops in order to meet the high requirements of demands of food and fibers. Efficiently, an irrigation system should correctly evaluate the amount of water and also the timing, when applying certain irrigation doses. Global warming of the planet, to which is added in some regions an irregular regime of precipitation and a scarcity of available water resources, requires precision irrigation systems. The rational use of water and inputs (mainly fertilizers and pesticides) is crucial in some areas of the planet suffering from a deficiency of water. Hence, in these regions where the environmental conditions are harsh to ensure an efficient crop growth. Moreover, plant diseases and pests impact the yields of crops. For these reasons is it why an early detection gives us the opportunity to treat the disease or pest as quickly and effectively as possible, in order, to reduce the impact of these latter. Nowadays, the identification of plant diseases and pest with Artificial Intelligence algorithms on video flow in real conditions with variable exposition are still being a very challenging problem. Researchers classically develop algorithms that are trained on calibrated exposition images, which does not perform well in real conditions. Furthermore, the processing of a video in real time needs specialized computing resources close to the pivot-center irrigation trained with AI algorithms on real images and then analyzes rapidly, detects problem, and then react accordingly. In this paper, we complete our previous proposed IoT system to optimize the water use and we displaced the computing of data at the edge level in order to be able to process videos locally, event the Internet connection is limited. This local computing power also allows us to manage the supply of fertilizers and the treatment of plant diseases, and pests.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Serverless edge systems simplify the deployment of real-time AI-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications at the edge. However, the heterogeneity of edge computing nodes – in terms of both hardware and software – makes load balancing challenging in these systems. In this paper, we propose a performance-driven, empirical weight-tuning approach to achieve effective load balancing based on the characteristics and capabilities of the nodes. By extensively profiling the nodes, we gather knowledge on performance metrics such as throughput, energy efficiency, response time, AI accuracy, and cost. Using this acquired knowledge, we introduce a weighted round-robin strategy to optimize the performance metrics according to their observed significance. To address multiple objectives, we introduce a multi-objective method that aims to strike a balance between any arbitrary set of performance objectives simultaneously. Additionally, we explore a coordinated distributed approach to overcome the limitations of centralized load balancing. Next, we introduce Hedgi, a heterogeneous serverless edge architecture designed to efficiently configure and utilize the derived load balancing policies, validated empirically. To demonstrate the practicality of Hedgi, we containerize and serverlessize a real-time object detection application. Extensive empirical studies are conducted using Hedgi to evaluate the performance of the proposed load balancing approach. The results provide valuable insights into the design trade-offs of various load balancing policies and system designs in the heterogeneous serverless edge.',\n",

This shift is driven by technological advances, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, sensor networks and Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, and the availability of large amounts of data that can be exploited by these technologies. However, the adoption of AI technologies for I4.0 varies considerably among industry sectors. This article complements broader reviews of I4.0 by examining the specific applications of IAI in several industry sectors, highlighting the issues and concerns encountered in and across different industry sectors, and discussing potential solutions that have been introduced along with opportunities and challenges for adoption. In this article, we review the literature to identify common themes and concerns related to the adoption of AI technologies in the context of I4.0 in several industry sectors. AI solutions are discussed in the context of an AI adoption pipeline that spans data collection, processing, model construction, and interpretation of results. Our findings indicate that although different industries share common issues, the adopted solutions are often specific to a particular industry sector, which may be difficult to transfer to other sectors. Moreover, industry sectors may pursue different adoption strategies due to varying experience and maturity of AI practices. These findings may inform managers, practitioners, and decision-makers who are involved in the adaptation of Industry 4.0 transformation in their respective industry sectors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The use of smart wireless remote water meters has become popular due to their efficiency in avoiding manual labor and automate meter reading. The current implementation of these measurement instruments often requires expensive external power sources and separate data aggregators, posing challenges for circuit safety and the goal of reducing carbon emissions in aging communities. In response, a novel wireless system has been developed to accurately measure water consumption in buildings. This system incorporates advanced machine learning techniques and utilizes the potential of water-based energy in a seamless manner. This novel methodology utilizes optical sensors to acquire visual data of water gauges and exploits machine learning techniques, specifically the AVSM model also called Advanced Visual Sensing Model (AVSM). This methodology employs a rigorous approach to achieve accurate metric determinations, thereby eliminating the necessity for additional hardware or excessive power configurations. Moreover, an integrated micro water generator has been seamlessly implemented, demonstrating the capability to effectively transfer energy to a lithium battery for the purpose of storage. This implementation guarantees consistent functionality and a significant decrease in reliance on external power supplies. The data augmentation procedure involves the stochastic manipulation of image luminance, resulting in encouraging results when used in conjunction with the AVSM model. Significantly, the dimensions of the model have been significantly decreased, while maintaining a commendable mean average precision (mAP). By leveraging this method and visual-based features, the system can contribute to overall building energy efficiency and reduce the burdens of manual meter reading while supporting CO2 emissions reduction as a feasible and cost-effective solution for building management, promoting sustainability, and advancing energy-efficient practices in old communities. This new wireless system for measuring water usage provides a practical and affordable way to enhance energy efficiency in buildings, lessen the workload of manual meter reading, and help meet carbon emissions reduction goals. As well as optimizing resource and energy use, this method also aligns with eco-friendly solutions to combat global warming and climate change.',\n",

Therefore, this study has conducted a comprehensive literature review for six years (2017–2022) on the convergence of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Distributed Ledger (Blockchain) technologies for supporting Dataspace integration efforts at the Edge. As an outcome, this study has identified relevant challenges that include heterogeneity, integration and interoperability, distributed security, trust, scalability, and resource management. It has also been found that very limited research covers the architectural aspects of distributed edge in the context of the convergence of technologies for Dataspace integration purposes. Therefore, this study has proposed an architectural framework – Distributed Edge Network Operations-oriented Semantic (DENOS) model that extends the traditional Cloud–Edge-Device architecture with three new layers – Semantic, Convergence, and Dataspace integration. In addition, the model leverages the power of semantic modelling (i.e., Processing, Service, and Data) context, which enables the model to have a dynamic implementation context to suit the diverse needs of target use cases. To showcase the validation of the model, a use case related to the digital traceable operation of the wind energy domain has been presented. The objective of the DENOS model is to enable Dataspace integration to build edge-enabled value chain networks. Thus, it contributes to secure and semantic integration using the convergence of resources and technologies, cross-domain collaboration, reusability and data-driven decision-making of resources.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agricultural and forestry biomass can be converted to biochar through pyrolysis gasification, making it a significant carbon source for soil. Applying biochar to soil is a carbon-negative process that helps combat climate change, sustain soil biodiversity, and regulate water cycling. However, quantifying soil carbon content conventionally is time-consuming, labor-intensive, imprecise, and expensive, making it difficult to accurately measure in-field soil carbon’s effect on storage water and nutrients. To address this challenge, this paper for the first time, reports on extensive lab tests demonstrating non-intrusive methods for sensing soil carbon and related smart biochar applications, such as differentiating between biochar types from various biomass feedstock species, monitoring soil moisture, and biochar water retention capacity using portable microwave and millimeter wave sensors, and machine learning. These methods can be scaled up by deploying the sensor in-field on a mobility platform, either ground or aerial. The paper provides details on the materials, methods, machine learning workflow, and results of our investigations. The significance of this work lays the foundation for assessing carbon-negative technology applications, such as soil carbon content accounting. We validated our quantification method using supervised machine learning algorithms by collecting real soil mixed with known biochar contents in the field. The results show that the millimeter wave sensor achieves high sensing accuracy (up to 100\\\\%) with proper classifiers selected and outperforms the microwave sensor by approximately 10\\\\%–15\\\\% accuracy in sensing soil carbon content.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Administrative and medical processes of the healthcare organizations are rapidly changing because of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This change demonstrates the critical impact of AI at multiple activities, particularly in medical processes related to early detection and diagnosis. Previous studies suggest that AI can raise the quality of services in the healthcare industry. AI-based technologies have reported to improve human life quality, making life easier, safer and more productive. This study presents a systematic review of academic articles on the application of AI in the healthcare sector. The review initially considered 1,988 academic articles from major scholarly databases. After a careful review, the list was filtered down to 180 articles for full analysis to present a classification framework based on four dimensions: AI-enabled healthcare benefits, challenges, methodologies, and functionalities. It was identified that AI continues to significantly outperform humans in terms of accuracy, efficiency and timely execution of medical and related administrative processes. Benefits for patients’ map directly to the relevant AI functionalities in the categories of diagnosis, treatment, consultation and health monitoring for self-management of chronic conditions. Implications for future research directions are identified in the areas of value-added healthcare services for medical decision-making, security and privacy for patient data, health monitoring features, and creative IT service delivery models using AI.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The impact that artificial intelligence (AI) has made across several industries in today’s society is clearly seen in applications ranging from medical diagnosis to customer service chatbots, to financial trading. It is also evident that AI has a huge role to play in emerging and future applications and will be increasingly used in mission-critical and time-sensitive applications such as remote surgeries, cybersecurity and self-driving cars. To satisfy the latency, security and privacy requirements that such applications require, AI which has gained its merit by utilising resource-heavy cloud infrastructure, needs to perform well in resource-constrained environments at the network edge. To address this need, this paper characterises the cloud-to-thing continuum and provides an architecture for enabling AI in fully edge-based scenarios. In addition, the paper provides strategies to tackle the communication inefficiencies that arise from the distributed nature of fully edge-based scenarios. Performance improvements exhibited by these strategies in state-of-the art research is presented, as well as directions where further advancements can be made. The material is presented in a simple manner to catalyse the understanding and hence the participation of multidisciplinary researchers in addressing this challenge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The current method employed in detecting damages present in canola kernels is inefficient and time-consuming. The sample preparation process is laborious and the judgment between sound and damaged seeds using visual methods is prone to errors as they are small and indistinguishable. To date, there is no hardware and supporting software solution that can expedite this time-consuming yet crucial task. This study demonstrates an end-to-end damage detection framework that has two components: a semi-automatic machine to crush the canola seeds to prepare the samples rapidly for detecting the damages and a supporting object detection algorithm based on a compressed YOLOv5s model. The lightweight detection model was deployed in an Edge-AI device and integrated with the crusher to detect the damages in real-time. Two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, viz. ShuffleNetV2 and MobileNetV3 were compared in terms of model parameters, computational cost, and model size to replace the standard CSPDarknet53 CNN backbone present in YOLOv5s. The best-performing model was deployed into an NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded device for real-time inferencing. Results indicate that in terms of model size, the ShuffleNetV2\\\\_YOLOv5s model was 56.5 and 80.4 \\\\% smaller than the MobileNetV3\\\\_YOLOv5s and the baseline YOLOv5s models, respectively. While, in terms of computational cost, the ShuffleNetV2\\\\_YOLOv5s model was 64.1 \\\\% and 99.5 \\\\% less expensive than the MobileNetV3\\\\_YOLOv5s and the baseline YOLOv5s models, respectively.

       "  'abstract': \"With the gradual disappearance of the demographic dividend and the labor shortage brought by the aging population, it is necessary and urgent to achieve a high degree of automation in agricultural scenarios. And with the development of science and technology, it has made certain progress. The autonomous mobility of platform plays a very important role in this progress. It expands the point-to-point agricultural activities of a single plant into the entire agriculture scene. The autonomous mobility of platforms is driven by the considerable multiple scenarios with different requirements and the need for an adaptable and reliable system. It contains mobile structure and motion control, which complement each other. This paper gives a detailed introduction and summarizes the state-of-the-art agricultural mobile platforms, sensor-based autonomous positioning and navigation methods, as well as their practical applications in different specific agricultural scenarios, especially harvesting task. It accounts for the absolute amount of labor in the overall agricultural task. Unlike, traditional industrial and urban, the agricultural scenarios have more unstructured complex environment. High autonomous mobility of the agricultural mobile platform, which requires the installation of more complex and comprehensive sensors sensitively perceive scene information and more intelligent positioning and navigation strategy, enable the mobile platform to securely, flexible perform agricultural tasks. Therefore, special attention is paid to the navigation strategy and mobile cruise strategy based on various sensor, to improve the autonomy of agricultural mobile platforms. It's potential challenges and future are prospected based on the development trend of agricultural mobile platforms.\",\n",

These strides have, in turn, impacted smart eco-cities, catalyzing ongoing improvements and driving solutions to address complex environmental challenges. This aligns with the visionary concept of smarter eco-cities, an emerging paradigm of urbanism characterized by the seamless integration of advanced technologies and environmental strategies. However, there remains a significant gap in thoroughly understanding this new paradigm and the intricate spectrum of its multifaceted underlying dimensions. To bridge this gap, this study provides a comprehensive systematic review of the burgeoning landscape of smarter eco-cities and their leading-edge AI and AIoT solutions for environmental sustainability. To ensure thoroughness, the study employs a unified evidence synthesis framework integrating aggregative, configurative, and narrative synthesis approaches. At the core of this study lie these subsequent research inquiries: What are the foundational underpinnings of emerging smarter eco-cities, and how do they intricately interrelate, particularly urbanism paradigms, environmental solutions, and data-driven technologies? What are the key drivers and enablers propelling the materialization of smarter eco-cities? What are the primary AI and AIoT solutions that can be harnessed in the development of smarter eco-cities? In what ways do AI and AIoT technologies contribute to fostering environmental sustainability practices, and what potential benefits and opportunities do they offer for smarter eco-cities? What challenges and barriers arise in the implementation of AI and AIoT solutions for the development of smarter eco-cities? The findings significantly deepen and broaden our understanding of both the significant potential of AI and AIoT technologies to enhance sustainable urban development practices, as well as the formidable nature of the challenges they pose. Beyond theoretical enrichment, these findings offer invaluable insights and new perspectives poised to empower policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to advance the integration of eco-urbanism and AI- and AIoT-driven urbanism. Through an insightful exploration of the contemporary urban landscape and the identification of successfully applied AI and AIoT solutions, stakeholders gain the necessary groundwork for making well-informed decisions, implementing effective strategies, and designing policies that prioritize environmental well-being.',\n",

There is promise in using these methods and innovations to monitor and evaluate animal welfare, but these techniques are difficult. Just like other revolutionary innovations, the utilization of the DT mechanism will improve disease analysis prediction for individual farms by a factor of 92\\\\%.

       "  'abstract': 'The integration of IoT and AI has gained significant attention as an emerging means to digitize manufacturing industries and drive sustainability in the context of Industry 4.0. In recent times, there has been a merging of AI and IoT technologies to form an “Artificial Intelligence of Things” (AIoT) infrastructure. This integration aims to enhance various aspects such as human–machine interactions, operations in the field of IoT, big data analytics, and more. AIoT-based solutions offer numerous benefits to the manufacturing industry. These solutions improve efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance safety measures. By utilizing AIoT, manufacturers are able to achieve Industry 4.0 goals and increase productivity through automation, process optimization, and more informed decision-making. Additionally, the adoption of AI and IoT-based solutions in manufacturing companies has increased substantially. These solutions enable the early detection and prevention of defects in equipment, leading to the production of high-quality products. By minimizing waste, reducing costs, improving efficiency, and boosting productivity, manufacturers can further optimize their operations. Academic researchers and industry practitioners are currently prioritizing the development of highly advanced and streamlined AIoT-based solutions specifically designed for sustainable manufacturing. The primary objectives of this paper are (i) to provide a comprehensive overview of the domain-centric AIoT-based industry technology for sustainable manufacturing; (ii) to conduct a thorough survey of the existing research on AIoT-enabled manufacturing; (iii) to discuss the current challenges faced by AIoT in the context of sustainable manufacturing and explore the research prospects in this field. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic review of state-of-the-art AIoT-based techniques employed in industries for sustainable manufacturing and analyzes the key contributions and opportunities.

Also, safer vegetables are required by peoples due to COVID-19 epidemic and radioactive pollution. In this paper, we propose an agricultural support system called VegeCareAI for agricultural workers. The proposed system supports vegetable classification, plant disease classification and insect pest classification to improve the crops’ productively. The support system can show the growth condition of vegetables. When there are some problems, the VegeCareAI presents information on how to deal with diseases and insect pests. From the results, we found that our proposed VegeCareAI tool has advantage for supporting several crops. For vegetable classification, our training data for 300 epochs predicted six kinds of vegetables correctly. For plant disease classification, for 400 epochs the accuracy is more than 96\\\\% accuracy for both potato and corn leaves. For insect pest classification, the accuracy of corn insect pests is more than 73\\\\%, but the results of different life cycles showed low classification accuracy, which present a future challenge.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Information extraction is a key activity for remote sensing images. A common distinction exists between knowledge-driven and data-driven methods. Knowledge-driven methods have advanced reasoning ability and interpretability, but have difficulty in handling complicated tasks since prior knowledge is usually limited when facing the highly complex spatial patterns and geoscience phenomena found in reality. Data-driven models, especially those emerging in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have achieved substantial progress in geoscience and remote sensing applications. Although DL models have powerful feature learning and representation capabilities, traditional DL has inherent problems including working as a black box and generally requiring a large number of labeled training data. The focus of this paper is on methods that integrate domain knowledge, such as geoscience knowledge and geoscience features (GK/GFs), into the design of DL models. The paper introduces the new paradigm of geoscience-aware deep learning (GADL), in which GK/GFs and DL models are combined deeply to extract information from remote sensing data. It first provides a comprehensive summary of GK/GFs used in GADL, which forms the basis for subsequent integration of GK/GFs with DL models. This is followed by a taxonomy of approaches for integrating GK/GFs with DL models. Several approaches are detailed using illustrative examples. Challenges and research prospects in GADL are then discussed. Developing more novel and advanced methods in GADL is expected to become the prevailing trend in advancing remotely sensed information extraction in the future.',\n",

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) applications benefit greatly from this paradigm, as they need to gather, preprocess, aggregate and analyze data at various scales. In such contexts, the increasing hardware/software resource availability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices provides the opportunity to exploit them not only as data sources in AI/ML infrastructures, but also as computational nodes for model training and inference; nevertheless, comprehensive frameworks are still mostly missing. This work introduces an innovative serverless computing architecture which expands the cloud-to-edge continuum toward IoT devices. The same functions can run on IoT, edge and cloud nodes with minimal to no code modification and they can be invoked through a uniform interface. A federated learning framework is defined based on the proposed architecture, exploiting an existing IoT-oriented ML algorithm in a novel way. Notably, IoT nodes are used for both federated training and local inference tasks. A full prototype implementation has been built with off-the-shelf technologies and devices.

       "  'abstract': 'Cloud computing offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) to provide compute, network, and storage capabilities to the clients utilizing the pay-per-use model. On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) based techniques are playing a major role in effective utilization of the computing resources and offering Quality of Service (QoS). Based on the customer’s application requirements, several cloud computing-based paradigms i.e., edge computing, fog computing, mist computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), cybertwin, and industry 4.0 have been evolved. These paradigms collaborate to offer customer-centric services with the backend of cloud server/data center. In brief, cloud computing has been emerged with respect to the above-mentioned paradigms to enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) for the users. In particular, ML techniques are the motivating factor to backend the cloud for emerging paradigms, and ML techniques are essentially enhancing the usages of these paradigms by solving several problems of scheduling, resource provisioning, resource allocation, load balancing, Virtual Machine (VM) migration, offloading, VM mapping, energy optimization, workload prediction, device monitoring, etc. However, a comprehensive survey focusing on multi-paradigm integrated architectures, technical and analytical aspects of these paradigms, and the role of ML techniques in emerging cloud computing paradigms are still missing, and this domain needs to be explored. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first survey that investigates the emerging cloud computing paradigms integration considering the most dominating problem-solving technology i.e., ML. This survey article provides a comprehensive summary and structured layout for the vast research on ML techniques in the emerging cloud computing paradigm. This research presents a detailed literature review of emerging cloud computing paradigms: cloud, edge, fog, mist, IoT, SDN, cybertwin, and industry 4.0 (IIoT) along with their integration using ML. To carry out this study, majorly, the last five years (2017-21) articles are explored and analyzed thoroughly to understand the emerging integrated architectures, the comparative study on several attributes, and recent trends. Based on this, research gaps, challenges, and future trends are revealed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Edge computing has become popular in the last decade and will advance in future to support real-time actionable analytics at the devices. One of the fundamental problems for future edge computing is to make distributed resource scheduling (DRS) decisions both at the end devices and edge devices to support requirements including autonomous computation, scalability, low-latency, etc. Several surveys in the literature on edge computing have considered some aspects related to DRS, such as challenges and solution approaches, particularly for computation offloading and data management. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive survey on DRS in edge computing. This paper surveys the challenging issues, motivations, and existing works for enabling DRS in edge computing. We define and identify the unique issues for DRS in edge computing compared to traditional works on parallel and distributed systems. The motivations for DRS in edge computing have been described by pointing out the benefits and emerging application scenarios. This paper also provides a taxonomy to classify the existing works from three perspectives, i.e., systems, problems, and solution approaches. Finally, we have outlined several future directions that can help researchers to advance the state-of-the-art.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart agricultural machinery is emerging as the future trend for field robots, and the fully automatic robot has a great application prospect. However, it is a big challenge for robots to navigate in complex farmland environments. In this research, 5 deep learning-based computer vision methods under different field scenes for field navigation line extraction were studied and successfully deployed on an embedded system, which can be integrated into robots for automatic navigation in the future. The field road was segmented by the semantic segmentation algorithm at first, and then the navigation line is extracted from the segmented image by a polygon fitting method. Finally, all the models are transformed through the TensorRT library and deployed on the edge computing device Jetson Nano. In the experiment, five reprehensive semantic segmentation networks namely UNet, Deeplabv3+, BiseNetv1, BiseNetv2, and ENet networks were selected. Among the five networks, Deeplabv3+ is the most accurate. In five scenes, its average segmentation accuracy is 84.87 \\\\%, and the navigation line error is 9.59 pixels. Especially in the third scene with shadow and occlusion, it performs best, with only 8.34 pixel error, But the speed of Deeplabv3+ is only 9.7 FPS. ENet, BiseNetv1, and BiseNetv2 are lightweight networks. The speed of ENet is 16.8 FPS, BiseNetv2 is 17 FPS, and BiseNetv1 is 15.8 FPS. In segmentation accuracy and navigation line error, ENet performs better than BiseNet series networks, which are 84.94 \\\\% and 10.73 pixels, respectively. In the third scene with shadow and occlusion, it also performs slightly better than BiseNet series networks. In summary, deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods have strong robustness and stability in complex environment compared with previous research. Among all currently available neural networks, ENet has the best performance and good application potential in field navigation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wildfires have emerged as one of the most destructive natural disasters worldwide, causing catastrophic losses. These losses have underscored the urgent need to improve public knowledge and advance existing techniques in wildfire management. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wildfires, propelled by the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning models, has created an unprecedented momentum to implement and develop more effective wildfire management. Although existing survey papers have explored learning-based approaches in wildfire, drone use in disaster management, and wildfire risk assessment, a comprehensive review emphasizing the application of AI-enabled UAV systems and investigating the role of learning-based methods throughout the overall workflow of multi-stage wildfire management, including pre-fire (e.g., vision-based vegetation fuel measurement), active-fire (e.g., fire growth modeling), and post-fire tasks (e.g., evacuation planning) is notably lacking. This survey synthesizes and integrates state-of-the-science reviews and research at the nexus of wildfire observations and modeling, AI, and UAVs - topics at the forefront of advances in wildfire management, elucidating the role of AI in performing monitoring and actuation tasks from pre-fire, through the active-fire stage, to post-fire management. To this aim, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing remote sensing systems with a particular focus on the UAV advancements, device specifications, and sensor technologies relevant to wildfire management. We also examine the pre-fire and post-fire management approaches, including fuel monitoring, prevention strategies, as well as evacuation planning, damage assessment, and operation strategies. Additionally, we review and summarize a wide range of computer vision techniques in active-fire management, with an emphasis on Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for wildfire classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring tasks. Ultimately, we underscore the substantial advancement in wildfire modeling through the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques and UAV-based data, providing novel insights and enhanced predictive capabilities to understand dynamic wildfire behavior.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the last decade, research and development in the field of multi access edge computing (MEC) has rapidly risen to prominence. One of the factors propelling MEC’s evolution is the ability to deploy edge servers capable of providing both communication and computational services in close proximity to the mobile user terminal. MEC has been regarded as a potentially transformative technique for fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless communication systems, as well as a possible complement to traditional cloud computing. Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with MEC will play a critical role by introducing an additional mobility based computational layer to provide more secure, efficient and faster services. UAV enabled MEC offers seamless connectivity, fulfilling the promise of 5G’s ubiquitous connectivity. Due to the enormous interest in UAV enabled MEC, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of published research articles in this domain; however, the research area still lacks a systematic study and categorization. We present a systematic literature review (SLR) on UAV enabled MEC, examining and analyzing data on the current state of the art using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. To streamline our assessment, this study analyzes several research papers carefully selected through a multi-stage process satisfying the eligibility criteria defined in the paper. One of the SLR’s primary contributions is to broadly classify the research in the UAV enabled MEC domain into different categories including energy efficiency, resource allocation, security, architecture, and latency. We have identified key findings, technology, and pros and cons for the selected articles under each category. Additionally, we discuss the key open issues related to scalability and fairness, resource allocation and offloading optimization, service delivery with a focus on quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS), and standardization. Finally, we discuss several future research directions that would address the aforementioned issues and emerging use cases for UAV enabled MEC.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The precision spraying robot dispensing herbicides only on unwanted plants based on machine vision detection is the most appropriate approach to ensure the sustainable agro-ecosystem and the minimum impact of nuisance weeds. However, the coexistence of crops and weeds, the similarities of plants and the multi-scale attribute of weeds make reliable detection difficult, leading to serious limitations in the application of deep learning method to target spraying in the field environment. In this paper, 4694 representative images are acquired from cotton field scenario as the data basis for deep learning model. A novel weed detection model is constructed by employing CBAM module, BiFPN structure and Bilinear interpolation algorithm. The proposed network can effectively learn the deep information and distinguish weeds from cotton seedlings in various complicated growth states. Evaluation experiments on our constructed dataset indicate that the proposed method reaches an mAP of 98.43\\\\% with faster inference speed than Faster R-CNN. Our proposed weed detection model is also deployed in spraying robot that we developed ourselves, and field trials are conducted for detection and spraying, which could maintain the excellent performance with mAP of 97.42\\\\% and effective spraying rate of 98.93\\\\%. The ability to successfully execute the weed detection and herbicide spraying management in the field lays foundation for targeted spraying in precision weed control, which has an excellent impact on cotton cultivation and growth.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In the pursuit of advancing food quality assessment, this study employs sophisticated data-driven techniques to delve into the complex realm of honey analysis. With the aim of unraveling the multifaceted nature of honey quality, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed to scrutinize the interplay of physicochemical, biochemical, and melissopalynological attributes in honey samples collected from the diverse drylands of Algeria. The dataset comprised 62 honey samples and eight crucial parameters. These parameters span climate zones (arid vs. desertic), honeybee breeds (Tellian, Saharan, and hybrid), honey extraction methods (manual pressing vs. electric centrifugation), and beekeeping systems (modern vs. traditional). Using SOMs, honey samples were categorized into distinct clusters that reflect variations across these four honey-related variables. Additionally, SOM heatmaps offer granular insights into individual parameters' distribution across the SOM map. Our analysis revealed nuanced distinctions in honey quality across North African regions, with specific parameters playing a pivotal role in defining honey quality. On average, the honey samples exhibited the following characteristics: a water content of 15.14 \\\\%, an electrical conductivity of 0.5 µS/cm, a pH of 4.20, a total sugar content of 83 \\\\%, a reducing sugar content of 63.83 \\\\%, a proline concentration of 382.7 mg/kg of honey, an hydroxymethylfurfural level of 77.4 mg/kg, and an average pollen grain density of 4.56 × 105 grains per 10 g of honey. Notably, the study identified clear demarcations in honey quality linked to beekeeping systems and revealed characteristics associated with bee breeds and extraction techniques. The results underscored the significance of selected honey parameters as key indicators of quality. This analytical approach not only offered a comprehensive assessment of honey quality but also holds potential for broader applications within the food industry. The findings invite further exploration into the ecological and genetic dimensions of beekeeping practices in North Africa to deepen our understanding of honey's multifaceted attributes. This study showcased the efficacy of SOMs and PCA in unraveling the complex fabric of honey quality assessment. These data-driven techniques, complemented by the structured dataset and analytical approach used, provided valuable insights that contributed to enhancing the scientific understanding of honey quality. By elucidating the complex relationships between physicochemical, biochemical, and melissopalynological parameters and honey quality, this research paves the way for future studies in this field and holds promise for broader applications in food quality assessment and monitoring.\",\n",

The participating devices in an IoT network usually have resource constraints and the devices are prone to different cyber attacks, leading to the loopholes in the security and authentication. As a revolutionized and innovated technology, blockchain, that is applied in cryptocurrency, market prediction, etc., uses a distributed ledger that records transactions securely and efficiently. To utilize the great potential of blockchain, both industries and academia have paid a significant attention to integrate it with the IoT, as reported by several existing literature.

Furthermore, both blockchain and AI can be integrated with the IoT to design an automated secure and robust IoT model, as mentioned by numerous existing works. In this survey, we present a discussion on the IoT, blockchain, and AI, along with the descriptions of several research works that apply blockchain and AI in the IoT. In this direction, we point out strengths and limitations of the related existing researches. We also discuss different open challenges to exploit the full capacities of blockchain and AI in designing an IoT-based model.

This kind of water meter is expensive, and the external power supply will increase the energy consumption of the building, which is not conducive to the circuit safety of the old community. In order to reduce the burden of manual meter reading and reduce the building\\'s \"carbon emissions\". A wireless water consumption sensing system for buildings based on machine learning and water energy collection is designed. Images are collected and recognized by visual sensors to realize the visual reading of water meter data. The system is powered by a 12V micro water generator and transferred to lithium battery energy storage to realize the self-energy supply of the whole system. The lightweight YOLOv5 was used to implement the model training process. Then, on the premise of the small sample data set, the data set was expanded by a data enhancement method which randomly changed the image brightness and hue. Finally, the training model is deployed on MCU through the TensorFlow Lite framework to realize edge AI detection. Experiments show that the size of the lightweight YOLOv5 is reduced by 87.1\\\\% and the mAP reaches 92.3\\\\%.

       "  'abstract': 'Background Nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining human health. Traditional methods used for assessing food composition \\\\& nutritional content often require destructive sample preparation, which can be time-consuming and costly. Therefore, computer vision-based approaches have emerged as promising alternatives that enable rapid and non-destructive analysis of various nutritional parameters in foods. Scope and approach In this review, we summarized computer vision applications in meat processing, grains, fruits and vegetables, and seafood. We reviewed recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning-based algorithms employed for food recognition and nutrient estimation. Various existing food recognition and nutrient estimation datasets are also reviewed. Key findings and conclusions Conventional methods offer some limitations, while vision-based technologies provide quick and non-destructive analysis of food composition \\\\& nutritional content. Computer vision and deep neural network architectures provide remarkable accuracy for food nutrient measurement. In conclusion, deep learning-based models are paving the way for a promising future in nutritional and health optimization research. In the future, vision-based technologies are expected to transform food classification and detection by enabling more rapid, affordable, and accurate nutritional analyses. Therefore, computer vision is developing into a useful tool for fast and precise evaluation of food nutrients without enabling samples to be damaged.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) for aerospace applications have brought about new opportunities for the fast-growing satellite industry. The progressive introduction of connected satellite systems and associated mission concepts is stimulating the development of intelligent CPS (iCPS) architectures, which can support high levels of flexibility and resilience in an increasingly congested near-Earth space environment. The need for higher levels of automation and autonomy in satellite operations has stimulated numerous research initiatives in recent years, focusing on the progressive enhancement of systemic performance (e.g., addressing safety, integrity and cyber-physical security metrics) and associated monitoring/augmentation approaches that can support Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operations (TASO). Despite these advances, in most contemporary satellite platforms, autonomy is restricted to a specific set of rules and cases, while the transition to TASO requires a paradigm shift in the design of both space vehicles and ground-based systems. In particular, the use of AI is seen as an essential enabler for TASO as it enhances system performance/adaptability and supports both predictive and reactive integrity augmentation capabilities, especially in Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS). This article provides a critical review of AI for satellite operations, with a special focus on current and likely future DSS architectures for communication, navigation and remote sensing missions. The aim is to identify key contemporary challenges and opportunities associated with space iCPS design methodologies to enhance the performance and resilience of satellite systems, supporting the progressive transition to TASO. A comprehensive review of relevant AI techniques is presented to critically assess the potential benefits and challenges of each method for different space applications. After describing the specificities of DSS and the opportunities offered by iCPS architectures, the co-evolution of space and control (ground and on-board) segments is highlighted as an essential next step towards enabling TASO. As an integral part of this evolutionary approach, the most important legal and regulatory challenges associated with the adoption of AI in TASO are also discussed.',\n",

Rapid advancements in geospatial technologies have resulted in new sensors and large volumes of geospatial data that have yet to be fully exploited given a variety of computational issues. Computational limitations involving storage, preprocessing, analysis, and modeling pose significant problems for Earth scientists. Consequently, advanced cyberinfrastructure is required to address geospatial data-science issues involving communication, representation, computation, information production, decision-making, and geovisualization. We identify and discuss important aspects of exploiting advances in cyberinfrastructure that involve computational scalability, artificial intelligence, and uncertainty characterization and analysis for addressing issues in the Earth sciences. Such developments can be termed cyber geographic information science and systems (cyberGIS). We discuss this important topic by addressing the significant overlap of concepts in GIS and geomorphology that can be formalized, digitally represented, implemented, and evaluated with cyberGIS. We then introduce the fundamentals of cyberinfrastructure and cyberGIS, including a discussion of the utilization of artificial intelligence and deep learning. We finally provide one case study demonstrating operational cyberGIS capabilities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the past years, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been utilized for the Internet of Things (IoT) in applications such as remote assistance based on augmented reality (AR) in smart factories, as well as powerline inspection and precision agriculture missions performed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the limited battery capacity and computing power of these devices (e.g., AR glasses and UAVs), edge computing is recognized as a means to empower the Internet of Things (IoT) with AI. Considering that multiple AI model inference tasks (e.g., point cloud classification and fault detection) are typically performed on the same stream of sensory data (e.g., UAV camera feed), we propose TORC (Tasks-Oriented Edge Computing) to reduce the bandwidth requirement. By incorporating AI into data transmission, the lightweight framework of TORC preserves edge computing servers’ ability to reconstruct/restore data into the original form, ensuring the proper coexistence of AI inference tasks and traditional non-AI tasks like human inspection, as well as simultaneous localization and mapping. It encodes and decodes sensory data with neural networks, whose training is driven by the AI inference tasks, in order to reduce bandwidth consumption and latency without impairing the accuracy of the AI inference tasks. Additionally, taking into account the mobility of the IoT and changes in the environment, TORC can adapt to variation in the bandwidth budget, as well as the temporally dynamic importance of AI inference tasks, without the need to train multiple neural networks for each setting. As a demonstration, empirical results conducted on the Cityscapes dataset and tasks related to autonomous driving show that, at the same level of accuracy, TORC reduces the bandwidth consumption by up to 48\\\\% and latency by up to 26\\\\%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Despite massive development in aerial robotics, precise and autonomous landing in various conditions is still challenging. This process is affected by many factors, such as terrain shape, weather conditions, and the presence of obstacles. This paper describes a deep learning-accelerated image processing pipeline for accurate detection and relative pose estimation of the UAV with respect to the landing pad. Moreover, the system provides increased safety and robustness by implementing human presence detection and error estimation for both landing target detection and pose computation. Human presence and landing pad location are performed by estimating the presence probability via segmentation. This is followed by the landing pad keypoints’ location regression algorithm, which, in addition to coordinates, provides the uncertainty of presence for each defined landing pad landmark. To perform the aforementioned tasks, a set of lightweight neural network models was selected and evaluated. The resulting measurements of the system’s performance and accuracy are presented for each component individually and for the whole processing pipeline. The measurements are performed using onboard embedded UAV hardware and confirm that the method can provide accurate, low-latency feedback information for safe landing support.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The digital economy, driven by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), has emerged as a significant contributor to economies worldwide. However, accurately defining and measuring its impact on national economies remains a complex endeavor. This paper explores the definition, measurement, role, and impacts of the digital economy across various economies. It also examines the involvement of governments and telecommunication regulators in assessing the digital economy and identifies future directions for developing countries. A systematic literature review utilizing the PRISMA Model is employed to investigate the factors and indices used to measure the digital economy. The findings highlight ongoing efforts to harmonize the definition and metrics; nonetheless, challenges persist due to the scarcity of appropriate datasets and variations in country-specific definitions. Additionally, the effectiveness of existing digital economy indices and toolkits in assessing the level of digitalization in developing countries is evaluated. The paper concludes that despite ongoing efforts to bridge the gaps, the concept of the digital economy remains defined and measured differently, necessitating a new definition that accounts for various contextual peculiarities. Furthermore, a roadmap is proposed to develop a toolkit that ensures comprehensive measurement, thus preventing an underestimation of the digital economy's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in developing countries. The paper underscores the need for international and multi-stakeholder dialogue to establish a common understanding of the digital economy's definition and measurement. Developing countries, such as Nigeria, are urged to develop or adopt new metrics tailored to their unique circumstances, facilitating an accurate and efficient quantification of the digital economy's impact on crucial indicators like GDP. Improved statistical data collection and recording methodologies are recommended for both governments and the private sector. Moreover, the paper advocates for the establishment of a Digital Economy Advisory Board (DEAB) in developing countries to maximize the benefits of the ongoing global transition to the digital economy.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The growing population and effect of climate change have put a huge responsibility on the agriculture sector to increase food-grain production and productivity. In most of the countries where the expansion of cropland is merely impossible, agriculture automation has become the only option and is the need of the hour. Internet of things and Artificial intelligence have already started capitalizing across all the industries including agriculture. Advancement in these digital technologies has made revolutionary changes in agriculture by providing smart systems that can monitor, control, and visualize various farm operations in real-time and with comparable intelligence of human experts. The potential applications of IoT and AI in the development of smart farm machinery, irrigation systems, weed and pest control, fertilizer application, greenhouse cultivation, storage structures, drones for plant protection, crop health monitoring, etc. are discussed in the paper. The main objective of the paper is to provide an overview of recent research in the area of digital technology-driven agriculture and identification of the most prominent applications in the field of agriculture engineering using artificial intelligence and internet of things. The research work done in the areas during the last 10 years has been reviewed from the scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. It has been observed that the digitization of agriculture using AI and IoT has matured from their nascent conceptual stage and reached the execution phase. The technical details of artificial intelligence, IoT, and challenges related to the adoption of these digital technologies are also discussed. This will help in understanding how digital technologies can be integrated into agriculture practices and pave the way for the implementation of AI and IoT-based solutions in the farms.',\n",

IoT’s cross-domain amalgamations with emergent technologies like 5G and blockchain affects human life. Hence, increase in reliance over IoT necessitates focus on its privacy and security concerns. Implementing security through encryption, authentication, access control and communication security is the need of the hour. These needs can be best catered with the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) that can help in realizing secure intelligent systems. In this work, the authors present a comprehensive review for securing Industrial-IoT (I-IoT) devices to contribute to the development of security methods for I-IoT deployed over 5G and blockchain. The survey provides a general analysis of the state-of-the-art security implementation and further assesses the product life cycle of IoT devices. The authors present numerous virtues as well as faults in the machine learning and deep learning algorithms deployed over the fog architecture in context with the security solutions. The potential security algorithms can help overcome many challenges in the IoT security and pave way for implementation with emerging technologies like 5G, blockchain, edge computing, fog computing and their use cases for creating smart environments.',\n",

IoT can lead to a highly effective and significant contribution to the agricultural sector’s improvement. Once these IoT sensors are placed beneath the surface for water content and salinity measurements, they will need to communicate with the mobile operator’s base stations. However, electromagnetic propagation through soil is very different from propagation through the air because of the soil’s permittivity and electrical conductivity. This study relates more precisely to low consumption and large-scale deployment purposes. The simulations will be carried out for unlicensed frequency bands to assess the theoretical approach studied.

       "  'abstract': \"Smart farming is a well-known and superior method of managing a farm, becoming more prevalent in today's contemporary agricultural practices. Crops are monitored for their overall health and productivity using various information and agricultural technology. This involves monitoring the state of the field crops and looking at various other indicators. The ultimate objective of smart farming is to decrease the amount of money spent on agricultural inputs while maintaining the same level of quality in the final result. The Internet of Things has enabled smart farming via different data collecting and storage methods. For example, intelligent sensor networks gather field data for optimum plant irrigation in contemporary irrigation systems. As the dependency of smart farming on the IoT environment increases, they become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The reason is that IoT networks include so many nodes with few resources available, making securing them a challenging problem. Therefore, the need for an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can adapt to such difficulties is of the utmost importance. This paper proposes a new system that detects intrusions in IoT networks used in agriculture. The NSL KDD data set is used to evaluate the proposed method, which starts by performing several pre-processing steps on the original feature set. Important features are selected using recursive feature elimination, then converted into square color images. Now input images are suitable to be learned by different CNN architectures such as VGG16, Inception, and Xception models. Performance comparisons of CNN models with classical machine learning algorithms are evaluated using accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, and precision metrics.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart Farming is the application of modern technologies, tools and gadgets for increasing the agricultural crops quality and quantity. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has had a prominent role in the establishment of smart farming. However, the application of this technology could be hard and, in some cases, challenging for the Middle Eastern users. Therefore, the research purpose is to identify the influential factors in the adoption and then application of IoT in smart farming by farmers with a contextualized approach in Iran, a typical Middle Eastern country. Thus, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) has contextually been used as the theoretical model of the research. The results accentuated and proved the positive impacts of performance expectancy (H1), effort expectancy (H2), social influence (H3), individual factors (H4), and facilitating conditions (H5), on the intention to use IoT technology. Ultimately, the results were indicating the significant impact of behavioral intention on the actual usage of IoT technology (H6). One of the implications of the research is for the IT policymakers in the agricultural sector in the Middle East, where water and cultivable land are two valuable but scarce economic resources. Hence, smart farming could not be promoted unless the farmers had fulfilled its prerequisite factors proposed by the research results for using the IoT technology.',\n",

It's anything but a main concern to resolve these issues and guarantee the security of IoT items and administrations. Clients should have certainty that IoT gadgets and related information administrations are secure, especially as this innovation develops more unavoidable and coordinated into our day by day lives. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the Internet of Things and to go through all of the known security concerns that the Internet of Things faces today. All of the findings are based on publicly available documentation for essential Internet of Things components. Threats to IoT security, both inherent and newly developed, are discussed, as well as numerous potentials. The attack surfaces of the IoT system are examined, as well as the potential hazards associated with each surface. We then, at that point go over the benefits, weaknesses, and qualities of every Deep Learning approach for IoT security. We talk about the advantages and disadvantages of applying Deep Learning to IoT security. Future exploration headings could be founded on these chances and difficulties.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recent technological advancements of Cloud Computing (CC), Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer vision, etc. enable the transformation of traditional agricultural practices into smart agricultural practices. In this background, the current article introduces a novel Hybrid Leader-based Optimization with DL-driven Weed Detection in IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture (HLBODL-WDSA) model. The prime aim of the proposed HLBODL-WDSA model is to collect the images using IoT devices and recognize the weeds automatically. Initially, the HLBODL-WDSA model enables the IoT devices to capture the farm images and transmits the images to the cloud server for examination. Next, the HLBODL-WDSA model applies YOLO-v5-based weed detection process in which HLBO algorithm is exploited as a hyperparameter optimizer. Finally, the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) model is applied for effective classification of the weeds. The proposed HLBODL-WDSA model was experimentally validated and the outcomes established the better performance of the proposed HLBODL-WDSA model over recent approaches.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The earthquakes in Eastern Mediterranean are mostly tectonic. The earthquakes that are 60 km deep in the ground are called Shallow earthquakes. The earthquakes in the eastern Mediterranean are generally shallow-orientated, and their depth often varies between 0 and 30 km. When there is a sudden plate movement within the earth's crust, increasing friction between two plates can result in earthquakes, which are harmful to human lives, buildings and the economy. With the technological developments in the world over the years, more information has been accessible and reliable. The Internet of things (IoT) and crowdsourcing have proven to be effective in predicting and preparing for the future natural hazards when combined with Machine Learning or Deep Learning. Machine learning does not require human interaction, as the machines automatically gets information and distributes in real-time to prevent major or severe damages, which are low-cost, has lower power consumption with reliable information. Short Message Service and Global Positioning System are still functional, even though powerlines and mobile beacons, were cut during recent massive earthquakes in some countries of Asia. The Seismic Alert System (SAS) is another design to prevent and reduce earthquake damages. The SAS was designed in 1996, to be effective with real time data from seismograms. The Earth cloud uses geophones which uses MEMS (micro electro-mechanical system). Geophones have an accelerometer and seismometers to detect the earth movement. Therefore, usage of sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor earthquakes and send early warning signals to prevent destruction of buildings and loss of life play a significant role.\",\n",

The IoT-based module is used to update the database with monitored data. Using this method, live data should be updated soon, and it can help in crop cultivation identification.

       "  'abstract': 'Internet of Things (IoT) is likely to revolutionize healthcare, energy, education, transportation, manufacturing, military, agriculture, and other industries. However, for the successful deployment of IoT in various industries, methods for detecting and preventing security breaches need to be designed and implemented. Over the past decade, a number of researchers in academia and industry have used Machine Learning (ML) techniques to design and implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for computer networks in general; however, not much work has been done for intrusion detection in IoT. Datasets collected by various organizations were used by many of these researchers to train ML models for predicting intrusions. It is common for datasets used in such systems to be imbalanced (i.e., not all classes have equal number of samples). Predictive models developed using machine learning algorithms can produce unsatisfactory results if imbalanced datasets are used for training the models. To remedy this problem, techniques such as random oversampling and undersampling do not produce robust models. Furthermore, ML models trained using traditional loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss, fail to accurately predict minority class instances. To overcome the data imbalance problem for intrusion detection in IoT, we leverage the specialized loss function, called focal loss, that automatically down-weighs easy examples and focuses on the hard negatives by facilitating dynamically scaled-gradient updates for training effective ML models. We implemented our approach using two well-known Deep Learning (DL) neural network architectures. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using three datasets from diverse IoT domains and compared our proposed approach with state-of-the-art intrusion detection models. We found that, our approach (training DL models using focal loss function) performed better with respect to accuracy, precision, F1 score and MCC score by as much as 24\\\\%, 39\\\\%, 39\\\\%, and 60\\\\%, respectively, compared to training them on the same datasets using cross-entropy loss function. We also compare our approach with two other state-of-the-art approaches and show that our approach performs better than these state-of-the-art approaches.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Different fields have been thriving with the advents in mobile communication systems in recent years. These fields reap benefits of data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) in next generation (5G and 5BG) mobile networks. The IoT concept transforms different fields by providing large amount of data to be used in their operations. This is achieved by massively utilized sensors and mobile devices that acquire data from internet connected devices to keep track of physical systems. Hence, different use cases benefit from the data generated thanks to future mobile network systems. Intelligent Transportation Systems, Smart Energy, Digital Twins, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Smart Health, Cyber Security are of significant use cases that big data plays an important role for them. Large amount of data entails more intelligent systems with respect to conventional methods, and it also entails highly reduced response time for use cases. Artificial intelligence and machine learning models are adept in satisfying the requirements of this big data situations for different use cases. In this sense, this paper provides a survey of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications for different use cases enabled by future mobile communication systems.

       "  'abstract': 'There is a great demand for an efficient security framework which can secure IoT systems from potential adversarial attacks. However, it is challenging to design a suitable security model for IoT considering the dynamic and distributed nature of IoT. This motivates the researchers to focus more on investigating the role of machine learning (ML) in the designing of security models. A brief analysis of different ML algorithms for IoT security is discussed along with the advantages and limitations of ML algorithms. Existing studies state that ML algorithms suffer from the problem of high computational overhead and risk of privacy leakage. In this context, this review focuses on the implementation of federated learning (FL) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for IoT security. Unlike conventional ML techniques, FL models can maintain the privacy of data while sharing information with other systems. The study suggests that FL can overcome the drawbacks of conventional ML techniques in terms of maintaining the privacy of data while sharing information with other systems. The study discusses different models, overview, comparisons, and summarization of FL and DL-based techniques for IoT security.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture is an essential sector needed for survival of the human community. Several measures have been taken to enhance the crop production. However harsh environmental conditions and frequent pest infestation lead to the agricultural loss. In such scenario, integration of advanced technologies such as advanced sensors coupled with Internet of Things (IoT) could escalate the agricultural production and minimize the economic loss. Studies have been conducted across the world that satisfactorily demonstrated the implication of integrated IoT-smart sensors in monitoring environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, temperature, and soil composition that are critical for crop growth. Green house gases such as Carbon dioxide, Methane, etc., are also measured through automated sensors. Smart farming also enables measurement of nitrogen contents in soil that helps farmers to determine the amount of fertilizers to be used in farm lands. Some IoT-enabled equipments and unmanned aerial vehicles are useful in accurate surveillance of pest attack and associated diseases in farm vegetation. Though the smart farming has great scopes in future, it faces certain limitations related to high implementation cost, data security, and lack of sufficient digital knowledge in farmers. Special economic policies, data encryption, and digital literacy could ease IoT-enabled smart farming in future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Smart livestock farming strives to make farming more lucrative, efficient, and ecologically beneficial by using digital technologies. Precision livestock fencing, in which each animal is followed and studied independently, is the most promising kind of smart livestock farming. The Internet of Things (IoT) allows farmers to save money and effort by keeping tabs on crops, mapping out their land, and giving them data to develop sensible management strategies for their farms. Surveillance, disaster management, firefighting, border patrol, and courier services employ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that are originally created for the military. The segment focuses on UAVs in livestock and agricultural production. This is achieved via employing robots, drones, remote sensors, and computer imagery in unison with ever-improving in-Depth Learning for farming. Deep learning (DL) algorithms find many uses in the agricultural sector, from identifying plant diseases to estimating yields to detecting weeds to forecasting the weather and determining how much water is in the soil. The challenging characteristics of smart livestock farming are climate change, biodiversity loss, and continuous monitoring. Hence, in this research, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles enabled Integrated Farm Management (UAV-IFM) has been designed to improve smart livestock farming. Safe and reliable tracking of livestock from farm to fork is made possible by this sensor, which has far-reaching implications for detecting and containing disease outbreaks and preventing the resulting financial losses and food-related health pandemics. UAV-IFM aims to improve the assessment process so that smart livestock farming may be more widely adopted and offers growth-supportive help to farmers. Conclusions gathered from this study's examination of the UAV-IFM reveal that these instruments correctly forecast and verify smart livestock farming management within the framework of the assessment procedure. The experimental analysis of UAV-IFM outperforms smart livestock farming in terms of efficiency ratio, performance, accuracy, and prediction.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) is the cornerstone of efficient water utilization for sustainability in agriculture. The standard Penman–Montieth (PM) approach of Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo), is complex due to the involvement of an extensive set of climatic conditions. The existing solutions of simplification of ETo predictions are not in accordance with the Penman–Montieth approach. A hybrid ensemble machine learning approach for simplification of ETo prediction is proposed using the Internet of Things(IoT) based crop field sensed climatic data. The proposed hybrid ensemble model is implemented with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and regression models. The proposed solution is unique for its utilization of flexible climatic conditions and in accordance with the standard Penman–Montieth (PM) approach. The proposed solution is able to predict daily ETo from only temperature and also can adjust ETo according to wind speed, humidity, and sunshine duration. The assessment of the proposed model exhibits a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94 compared to 0.91 from the basic ANN model. The proposed hybrid ensemble model also exhibits a low RMSE of 0.86, MAE of 0.75 mm day−1, and MAPE of 15.05\\\\%, compared to 0.91, 0.75 mm day−1, and 20.40\\\\% from the basic ANN model. The ETo predictions by the proposed hybrid ensemble model also exhibit a higher Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.917 with the ETo by the Penman–Montieth (PM) approach, compared to 0.778 by the basic ANN model. The statistics reveal the accuracy and goodness of fit of the proposed hybrid ensemble machine learning model.',\n",

A fusion system based on fuzzy logic controller (FLC) was used to combine the collected data and to supply smart and optimal decisions to manage the internal climate and irrigation. The user can remotely monitor the greenhouse using a Human Machine Interface (HMI) developed under Node-RED server of IBM.

       "  'abstract': \"Frugal innovation, also known as frugal engineering or innovation, is an approach to product development and problem-solving that focuses on creating simple, affordable, and effective solutions. The research on frugal innovation is evolving which is mainly rooted in the challenges faced by people living in developing countries, where resource constraints and limited access to technology, infrastructure, and capital make it difficult to adopt traditional expensive and complex solutions. This study attempts to explore the impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools on frugal innovation from the perspective of China, a developing nation. Moreover, how entrepreneurial knowledge can play a moderating role among the nexus of frugal innovation, IoT, and AI is a key question of this study. This study spotlights the proposed inquiry based on seven hundred and seventy-nine responses as analyzed using SEM approach by SmartPLS. This study affirmed that IoT and AI both are valid predictors of frugal innovation therefore management should incorporate both capabilities to achieve frugal innovation and to win over competitors in today's technological-oriented era. This study highlights that acceptance of technology is imperative where entrepreneurial skills can play a significant role in incorporating innovative technologies like IoT and AI models into practices. This study also enlists several managerial implications along with limitations and future research possibilities for worldly scholars.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The prevalence of security vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) applications poses a serious threat to enterprise systems, necessitating sophisticated and reliable defense solutions to counter emerging and evolving threats. For the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), stakeholders require trustworthy and sustainable systems that can prevent the loss of human life during critical operations. The impact of multi-variant persistent and sophisticated bot attacks on connected IIoTs is potentially catastrophic, and their detection presents a highly complex and critical challenge. Therefore, there is a pressing need for efficient and timely detection of IIoT botnet attacks. This research paper proposes a robust deep learning model named AttackNet for the detection and classification of different botnet attacks in IIoT based on adaptive based CNN-GRU model. The model is extensively evaluated using the latest dataset and standard performance evaluation metrics, demonstrating its capacity to protect IIoT networks against sophisticated cyber-attacks with a testing accuracy of 99.75\\\\%, a loss of 0.0063, precision and recall score of 99.75\\\\% and 99.74\\\\% respectively. Our proposed model demonstrates superior accuracy, particularly within the N\\\\_BaIoT dataset. It achieves an outstanding accuracy of 99.75\\\\% across ten classes, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques by a substantial margin ranging from 3.2\\\\% to 16.07\\\\%. Moreover, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection systems in IIoT based on a real-time IoT device dataset in terms of detecting and classifying botnet attacks accurately.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Deep learning (DL) is a robust data-analysis and image-processing technique that has shown great promise in the agricultural sector. In this study, 129 papers that are based on DL applications used in agriculture are discussed, categorizing them into five areas: crop yield prediction, plant stress detection, weed and pest detection, disease detection, and smart farming. Smart farming is sub-categorized as water management, seed analysis, and soil analysis. This study highlights the potential of deep learning in enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting economic growth. The study found that supervised learning networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), AlexNet, and ResNet, are primarily used in agriculture to enhance economic growth. However, there is a need to develop new DL techniques that can improve model performance and reduce inference time for practical applications. In this review, critical research gaps, particularly in the development of new techniques, are analyzed. This study emphasizes the importance of continued research in this area to fully leverage DL's potential of DL for smart farming and to achieve sustainable agricultural development.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed many aspects of modern life, from healthcare and transportation to home automation and industrial control systems. However, the increasing number of connected devices has also led to an increase in security threats, particularly from botnets. To mitigate these threats, various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been proposed for IoT botnet attack detection. This systematic review aims to identify the most effective ML and DL techniques for detecting IoT botnets by delving into benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and data pre-processing techniques in detail. A comprehensive search was conducted in multiple databases for primary studies published between 2018 and 2023. Studies were included if they reported the use of ML or DL techniques for IoT botnet detection. After screening 1,567 records, 25 studies were included in the final review. The findings suggest that ML and DL techniques show promising results in detecting IoT botnet attacks, outperforming traditional signature-based methods. However, the effectiveness of the techniques varied depending on the dataset, features, and evaluation metrics used. Based on the synthesis of the findings, this review proposes a taxonomy for ML and DL techniques in IoT botnet attack detection and provides recommendations for future research in this area. This review illuminates the considerable potential of ML and DL approaches in bolstering the detection of IoT botnet attacks, thereby offering valuable insights to researchers involved in the domain of IoT security.',\n",

Over-reliance on non-renewable resources leads to depletion and price spikes, making renewable alternatives necessary. Biodiesel is an eco-friendly and non-toxic fuel that closely resembles traditional fossil fuels. It is produced from various sources, including animal fat, palm oil, and non-edible plant oil. Biodiesel releases fewer harmful air pollutants and greenhouse gases than fossil fuels and is simpler to manage. Despite these advantages, it cannot replace traditional diesel fuel on a large scale. This overview summarizes biodiesel production, explaining the different types of feedstock utilized and their benefits and drawbacks. Various biodiesel production methodologies are discussed. The primary objective of this article is to inform engineers, industrialists, and researchers involved in waste biodiesel, as well as to highlight waste biodiesel as a potential substitute for fossil fuels. This review article discusses the nano-additives in biodiesel and applications of internet of things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning in biofuel. This review shows that nano-additives can potentially improve biodiesel fuel properties, favorable economic and policy environments promoting biodiesel production, and internet of things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies optimize the biodiesel production processes. These advances can help promote biodiesel as a cleaner, renewable energy source, lowering the consumption of fossil fuels. It also suggests further biofuel development by improving efficiency, expanding feedstock options, creating policy support, developing infrastructure, and increasing public awareness.',\n",

The sensors gather data from crops and fused with the local unit and forwarded to the cluster heads of network. To achieve the disease free crops and therein improve the productivity we have proposed a novel energy efficient IoT based smart farming approach, in which we have utilized K-means algorithm for the cluster formation and Adaptive Mud Ring optimization algorithm (AMR) for CH and energy efficient optimal path. The collected data via the CH are then stored in the cloud storage. Subsequently, the data are accessed via the proposed Hybrid Artificial Neural Network (HANN) to predict the diseases. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is hybridized using the Google Net in order to extract the exact features to predict the diseases. Performance validation is effectuated with Network Simulator-2 (NS-2) software and the results are compared with the state-of-art works.

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture farms such as crop, aquaculture and livestock have begun the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in improving their productivity and product quality. However, microalgae farming which requires precise monitoring, controlling and predicting the growth of microalgae biomass has yet to incorporate with IoT and AI technology, as it is still in its infancy phase. Particularly, the cultivation stage of microalgae involves many essential parameters (i.e. biomass concentration, pH, light intensity, temperature and tank level) which require precise monitoring as these parameters are important to ensure an effective biomass productivity in the microalgae farming. Besides, the conventional practices in the current process equipment are still powered by electricity, thus further development by integrating IoT into these processes can ease the production process. Further to that, many researchers has studied the machine learning approach for the identification and classification of microalgae. However, there are still limited studies reported on applying machine learning for the application of microalgae industry such as optimising microalgae cultivation for higher biomass productivity. Therefore, the implementation of IoT and AI in microalgae farming can contribute to the development of the global microalgae industry. The purpose of this current review paper focuses on the overview microalgae biomass production process along with the implementation of IoT toward the future of smart farming. To bridge the gap between the conventional and microalgae smart farming, this paper also highlights the insights on the implementation phases of microalgae smart farming starting from the infant stage that involves the installation and programming of IoT hardware. Then, it is followed by the application of machine learning to predict and auto-optimise the microalgae smart farming process. Furthermore, the process setup and detailed overview of microalgae farming with the integration of IoT have been discussed critically. This review paper would provide a new vision of microalgae farming for microalgae researchers and bio-processing industries into the digitalisation industrial era.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Indian sugar industry is the second largest in the world. Sugar is an essential domestic grocery item required in India producing over 25 million tonnes per annum. Sugarcane is the root of sugar products that grow in over 5 million hectares all over India. However, nearly 1.5 million hectares of overall farms are saline soil lands (high salt content). This leads to lower yields in sugarcane agriculture than what would be expected. Therefore, tackling the salinity problem is crucial to achieve strong food security as well as tackle the sustainability of farming practices in India that have reach beyond just sugarcane. This research proposes efficient, sustainable, smart farming techniques for sugarcane cultivation in salt-affected lands with the help of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML). The proposed model has been implemented in a real-world two hectare sugar cane field cultivated from saline soils using Raspberry PI IoT nodes to control the drip irrigation (water supply). The Naïve Bayes model has been used to train and predict the leaching requirement suggested by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for efficient leaching water requirements. The performance of the proposed model has been evaluated in terms of sugar cane growth, cost of cultivation, as well as water requirements leading to an improved outlook for future use. Moreover, our results have been compared with regular sugar cane cultivation to show their effectiveness.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Many smart applications, including smart cities, healthcare, smart agriculture, manufacturing, etc., have widely adopted the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart Farming (SF) integrates a set of technologies, such as cloud and edge computing and greenhouse concepts, to improve agricultural processes. Due to its capacity to generate fresh agricultural products at an incredible pace of development and output, the greenhouse business has recently attracted the attention of the farming community. However, the cost of labor and energy consumption causes the greenhouse’s production cost to rise by roughly 40\\\\%–50\\\\%. To avoid this, SF concepts have been introduced. Data management in SF has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its high potential for more accurate and cost-effective agriculture. Traditional client–server and cloud-based data management systems are plagued by single faults, data protection, centralized data management, and system vulnerabilities. In this paper, an IoT-based framework is proposed for SF to improve the productivity of crops. AI-based precision model is introduced in the framework, which can be integrated with remote sensor data for correct prediction of crop growth in smart agriculture. The result shows that the random forest model works better with 97\\\\% accuracy compared to Support Vector Classifier (SVC) have 93\\\\%, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) have 90\\\\%, and Logistic Regression 84\\\\%. This technology helps to reduce costs while also improving the overall quality of the agricultural process and product management with blockchain-based supply chain management to enhance farmers’ economic backdrop. The blockchain performance is evaluated on gas consumption, execution time, throughput and latency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture is strongly influenced by the rapidly growing population and the human-induced climate change. There is a constant increasing demand to enhance farming productivity and deal with the extreme weather conditions that affect crop performance and yield. To ensure food security and sustainable environmental management, it becomes necessary to modernize the agriculture domain and therefore an automated and data-driven approach for crop damage assessment is suggested. Until now, decision-making for crop management is made based on manually collected data from the field, which is a costly, slow, and error-prone process. Thus plenty of smart farming solutions are introduced for monitoring crop performance and health. This chapter presents a newly developed web service called ResAGRI (Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture) which is designed to deliver location-based information on climate-related crop damage assessment. The suggested method precisely detects crop damages at a parcel level of detail by interweaving field data collected from in situ Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Earth Observation (EO) satellites, reducing the need for field visits. Three pilots were designed in Greece located in Thessaly, Rhodope, and Crete regions. The crop types of cotton, tomato, and grape vines were assessed during the growing seasons of 2020 and 2021. Based on the acquired field weather data, severe weather events affecting the crops were identified. Damage maps for every harmful event were generated by applying a pre-post analysis and by exploiting location-based modelled past NDVI time series. The disastrous events and the corresponding crop damages are addressed and discussed. The suggested method is efficient as the detected extreme weather events and crop damages have been verified by appraisers who visited the area to perform the field damage assessment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Crop health monitoring and weed removal are two crucial elements dictating efficient, productive and resilient cultivation. Due to frequent attacks by pest and pathogens, the crops become diseased resulting in degradation of the quality and quantity of the production. The process of continuous monitoring of crop health is challenging and requires the involvement of information and communication technologies (ICT). The outcome is precision agriculture where the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are vital ingredients. The design of an integrated approach of precision agriculture based on IoT and AI is discussed here which is tailored for real time crop health monitoring and performs various other operations like weed detection, ambient air sensing, watering the vegetation automatically at regular intervals of time, spraying of pesticides etc. The proposed system is a combination of an IoT formed using sensors and devices, image processing and machine learning (ML)/ deep learning (DL) techniques confined to the cultivation of fifteen varieties of beans found in India. The work involves two intelligent learning models configured to capture spatio-temporal attributes of image samples and sensor inputs and for real time discrimination between healthy and diseased bean leaves, detection of weeds growing around the cultivation land and also for process control. The first approach employs a DL structure named EfficientNetB7 along with a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) while the second method adopts a VGG16 with an integrated attention mechanism. Also experiments have been carried out using benchmark ML classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) combined with feature extraction techniques. Segmentation methods have been used to separate out the diseased sections of the leaves which are then used as apriori labels for the classifiers to reinforce the previously known details of the bean varieties. Subsequently, the trained networks are tested with bean leaf samples collected from cultivation farms. Results show that our proposed DL models could accurately predict the health state of the bean leaves with less computation time. With an automated approach of bean leaf health discrimination, weed detection and process control, the cost effectiveness of the overall effort is enhanced. Further, the sensor pack also provides precise thresholds at which water sprinkling could be initiated resulting in water conservation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart agriculture using the Internet of Things (IoT) is an Industry 4.0 technology used in rural and urban environments. Industry 4.0 is a new class of the Industrial Revolution that focuses heavily on automation, interconnection, real-time data, and artificial intelligence (AI). With the growing demand for agricultural automation to increase farm output while meeting minimal criteria, smart farming has emerged as one of the fundamental applications of Industry 4.0. We propose an AI-based smart farming protocol since AI approaches are essential for the performance improvement of Industry 4.0 standards. We design Lightweight Clustering Protocol for Industry 4.0 Enabled Precision Agriculture (LCIPA) protocol via clustering and routing algorithms. Smart farming such as Industry 4.0, tackles long-distance communications, energy efficiency, computing efficiency, and assured QoS performance. In the clustering phase, we compute the direct and indirect sensor node parameters to produce the integrated fitness function value. The optimal selection of Cluster Head (CH) and reliable data forwarders is obtained using this novel fitness function. We establish the objective function for clustering and routing to reduce energy consumption and communication overhead while maximizing network performance using an integrated fitness function. The proposed fitness function is used to develop the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (FBA) for optimum CH selection. A lightweight route discovery approach is based on periodic fitness ratings for inter-cluster and intra-cluster data transfer without specific processing. The simulation results reveal the efficiency of the LCIPA protocol compared to underlying methods.',\n",

Nearly 58 percent of a country’s primary source of livelihood is farming. Farmers till date had adopted conventional farming techniques. These techniques were not precise thus reduced the productivity and consumed a lot of time. Precise farming helps to increase the productivity by precisely determining the steps that needs to be practiced at its due season. Predicting the weather conditions, analyzing the soil, recommending the crops for cultivation, determine the amount of fertilizers, pesticides that need to be used are some elements of precision farming. Precise Farming uses advanced technologies such as IOT, Data Mining, Data Analytics, Machine Learning to collect the data, train the systems and predict the results. With the help of technologies Precise farming helps to reduce manual labor and increase productivity. Farmers have been facing various challenges in these recent times, this includes crop failure due to less rainfall, infertility of soil and so on. Due to the changes taking place in the environment the proposed work helps to identify how to manage crops and harvest in a smart way. It guides an individual for smart farming. The aim of this work is to help an individual cultivate crops efficiently and hence achieve high productivity at low cost. It also helps to predict the total cost needed for cultivation.

       "  'abstract': \"In the face of increasing agricultural demands and environmental concerns, the effective management of weeds presents a pressing challenge in modern agriculture. Weeds not only compete with crops for resources but also pose threats to food safety and agricultural sustainability through the indiscriminate use of herbicides, which can lead to environmental contamination and herbicide-resistant weed populations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a paradigm shift in agriculture, particularly in the domain of weed management. AI's utilization in this domain extends beyond mere innovation, offering precise and eco-friendly solutions for the identification and control of weeds, thereby addressing critical agricultural challenges. This article aims to examine the application of AI in weed management in the context of weed detection and the increasing impact of deep learning techniques in the agricultural sector. Through an assessment of research articles, this study identifies critical factors influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in weed management. These criteria encompass factors of AI adoption (food safety, increased effectiveness, and eco-friendliness through herbicides reduction), AI implementation factors (capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and outcomes and accuracy), ancillary technologies (IoT, UAV, field robots, and herbicides), and the related impact of AI methods adoption (economic, social, technological, and environmental). Of the 5821 documents found, 99 full-text articles were assessed, and 68 were included in this study. The review highlights AI's role in enhancing food safety by reducing herbicide residues, increasing effectiveness in weed control strategies, and promoting eco-friendliness through judicious herbicide use. It underscores the importance of capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and accuracy metrics in AI implementation, emphasizing their synergy in revolutionizing weed management practices. Ancillary technologies, such as IoT, UAVs, field robots, and AI-enhanced herbicides, complement AI's capabilities, offering holistic and data-driven approaches to weed control. Additionally, the adoption of AI methods influences economic, social, technological, and environmental dimensions of agriculture. Last but not least, digital literacy emerges as a crucial enabler, empowering stakeholders to navigate AI technologies effectively and contribute to the sustainable transformation of weed management practices in agriculture.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The use of Internet of Things (IoT) networks offers great advantages over wired networks, especially due to their simple installation, low maintenance costs, and automatic configuration. IoT facilitates the integration of sensing and communication for various industries, including smart farming and precision agriculture. For several years, many researchers have strived to find new sources of energy that are always “cleaner” and more environmentally friendly. Energy harvesting technology is one of the most promising environment-friendly solutions that extend the lifetime of these IoT devices. In this paper, the state-of-art of IoT energy harvesting capabilities and communication technologies in smart agriculture is presented. In addition, this work proposes a comprehensive architecture that includes big data technologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based systems for innovative farm architecture. The solution answers some of the biggest challenges the agriculture industry faces, especially when handling small files in a big data environment without impacting the computation performance. The solution is built on top of a pre-defined big data architecture that includes an abstraction layer of the data lake that handles data quality following a data migration strategy to ensure the data's insights. Furthermore, in this paper, we compared several machine learning algorithms to find the most suitable smart farming analytics tools in terms of forecasting and predictions.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"India's agricultural sector is dwindling, which has an impact on ecosystem output. Smart farming increases crop productivity by reducing waste and making effective use of fertiliser. Various Machine Learning techniques together with IoT enabled are developed for precision agriculture. However, the existing techniques face difficulties in forecasting weather and predicting disease accurately. In this work, a system is developed to automate weather forecasting and field monitoring using sensors. Wireless transmission is used to transfer sensor data to a web server database. In the first step, the collected data is pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data is then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. In the second step, crop images acquired from sensors for disease prediction are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization for contrast enhancement of image. Pre-processed images are then fed into ResNet50 for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by the systems. On the other hand, regarding the information about horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers. The proposed method is tested with several metrics which attain better performance like 94\\\\% accuracy for weather forecasting and 98\\\\% accuracy for field monitoring. Thus the proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support farmers to achieve a high quantity of crop production in lesser time.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Blockchain quickly became an important technology in many applications of precision agriculture discipline. The need to develop smart P2P systems capable of verifying, securing, monitoring, and analyzing agricultural data is leading to thinking about building blockchain-based IoT systems in precision agriculture. Blockchain plays the role of pivotal in replacing the classical methods of storing, sorting and sharing agricultural data into a more reliable, immutable, transparent and decentralized manner. In precision farming, the combination of the Internet of Things and the blockchain will move us from only smart farms only to the internet of smart farms and add more control in supply-chains networks. The result of this combination will lead to more autonomy and intelligence in managing precision agriculture in more efficient and optimized ways. This paper exhibits a comprehensive survey on the importance of integrating both blockchain and IoT in developing smart applications in precision agriculture. The paper also proposed novel blockchain models that can be used as important solutions for major challenges in IoT-based precision agricultural systems. In addition, the study reviewed and clearly discussed the main functions and strengths of the common blockchain platforms used in managing various sub-sectors in precision agriculture such as crops, livestock grazing, and food supply chain. Finally, the paper discussed some of the security and privacy challenges, and blockchain-open issues that obstacles developing blockchain-IoT systems in precision agriculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Internet of Things (IoT) has played a key role in developing sustainable precision agriculture. This study addresses water and fertilizer allocation issues derived from the IoT-enabled precision agriculture for achieving sustainable irrigation and fertilization management. Existing studies on irrigation and fertilization management have more focused on short-term management and valued the timeliness of resource scheduling. However, short-term management is unsustainable since it ignores the economic and environmental goals of production activities and not applicable when the resources are limited. To fill this gap, this study develops a framework for the IoT-based irrigation and fertilization system in which both long-term and short-term planning are considered. Based on the framework, an integer linear programming model is developed for allocating limited resources among multiple crops with the goal of maximizing the economic profits and environmental benefits. After that, a hybrid genetic algorithm is designed to solve the optimization model. Finally, numerical experiments based on a case study are conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed model and solving method. Results have confirmed that the optimization model presented in this study can promote sustainable irrigation and fertilization management in precision agriculture by offering more economic and environmental benefits than empirical models. Also, related management implications are obtained from sensitivity analysis to support the decision-making of managers, involving planting structure design, strategies selection of water and fertilizer storage and replenishment.',\n",

In this new digital age, the development of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has allowed for acceleration and improvement in the processing of collected data. To highlight the evolution and advances observed in deep learning in agriculture, we conducted a bibliometric study on more than 400 recent research studies. The analyses carried out on recent research works suggest that deep learning is widely involved in the digitization of agriculture areas with high accuracy exceeding the standard image processing techniques. Most of the works focus on crop classification problems, weed, and pest identification. Their methods are mainly based on convolutional neural network architecture. From the cases study, we have identified three key challenges that are essential in the deep learning methods applied in agriculture: (i) the need to consider the perception of the domain actors, their appropriation or interaction with the existing tools; (ii) the requirement to perform statistical tests to analyze the performance of the classifiers resulting from the learning process; and (iii) the need to perform statistical cross-validations with the training data. In the end, we summarized the agricultural data processing process consisting of several parts, for a better consideration of the expectations resulting from the challenges addressed. We consider that this study can serve as a guideline of research for the scientist and practician in the application of deep learning methodology in agriculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The microlevel monitoring and control in the agricultural fields are the key factors in the growth of quality production. Precision agriculture is the leading trend in this era to encounter the need of increasing human population on planet Earth. The quality and quantity of the agricultural yield depend on certain parameters such as fertile soil, water, and fertilizers. Nowadays the entire agricultural activities suffer due to unexpected environmental changes. Hence, the need for timely monitoring and providing control facilities to crops is essential. Precision agriculture provides management of crop production through smart technology by monitoring the required parameters. The soil is the key factor in the field of agriculture; therefore the study of soil parameters such as pH, electric conductivity (EC), temperature, humidity, and moisture is very crucial. In the present work, an Internet of things (IoT)-based portable miniaturized advanced microcontroller-based sensor system has been developed to monitor the soil parameters. The sensor nodes are developed for real-time monitoring of soil parameters, such as pH, EC, temperature, humidity, and moisture. The present system is calibrated and standardized with standard laboratory instruments. This sensor system found a wide range of applications in the determination of soil parameters with 99\\\\% accuracy. The extension of this work is to use microwave C band Sentinel-1 satellite data of selected agricultural land and retrieval of soil parameters such as vegetation, soil moisture, dielectric constant (ε), and backscattering coefficient (σ0) through image analysis techniques. Further, with the help of geometrical properties such as texture and surface roughness of the area of interest, the said parameters can be retrieved. In summary, in the present study, the agricultural soil parameters have been retrieved by an IoT-based sensor system, the microwave satellite dataset, and with the geometrical module. Results from all the three systems are compared and interpreted for the application in the precision agricultural system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart farming with artificial intelligence provides an efficient solution to today’s agricultural sustainability challenges. Machine learning, Deep learning, and time series analysis are essential in smart farming. Crop selection, crop yield prediction, soil compatibility classification, water management, and many other processes are involved in agriculture. Machine learning algorithms are used for crop selection and management, Deep learning techniques are used for crop selection and forecasting crop production, and time series analysis is used for demand forecasting of crops, commodity price prediction, and crop yield production forecasting. Crops are chosen using machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms based on soil, soil compatibility classification, and other factors. In the agriculture industry, this article offers a thorough review of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Crop data sets can be used to classify soil fertility, crop selection, and many other aspects using machine learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithms can be applied to farming data to do time series analysis and crop selection. Because there is more need for food due to the growing population, crop production forecasting is one of the crucial tasks. Therefore, future crop production must be predicted in order to overcome food insufficiency. In this article, several time series algorithms were reviewed. Suggesting appropriate crop recommendations using machine and deep learning by estimating crop yield by using time series analysis will reduce food insufficiency in the future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recently, there has been a substantial interest in on-device Machine Learning (ML) models to provide intelligence for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as image classification, human activity recognition, and anomaly detection. Traditionally, ML models are deployed in the cloud or centralized servers to take advantage of their abundant computational resources. However, sharing data with the cloud and third parties degrades privacy and may cause propagation delay in the network due to a large amount of transmitted data impacting the performance of real-time applications. To this end, deploying ML models on-device (i.e., on IoT devices), in which data does not need to be transmitted, becomes imperative. However, deploying and running ML models on already resource-constrained IoT devices is challenging and requires intense energy consumption. Numerous works have been proposed in the literature to address this issue. Although there are considerable works that discuss energy-aware ML approaches for on-device implementation, there remains a gap in the literature on a comprehensive review of this subject. In this paper, we provide a review of existing studies focusing on-device ML models for IoT applications in terms of energy consumption. One of the key contributions of this study is to introduce a taxonomy to define approaches for employing energy-aware on-device ML models on IoT devices in the literature. Based on our review in this paper, our key findings are provided and the open issues that can be investigated further by other researchers are discussed. We believe that this study will be a reference for practitioners and researchers who want to employ energy-aware on-device ML models for IoT applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Agriculture is the major occupation and the main origin of income in India, and most of the population depends on agriculture for their living. The smart farming system's foremost goal is to monitor farmlands by automatically rinsing the lands with appropriate water and a pest detection framework. The conventional agricultural methods lack higher crop productivity with increased human efforts. Hence, the paper proposes an IoT-based solution for smart farming. The proposed system focuses on automatic irrigation of water and plant disease detection. It uses machine learning algorithms to accurately predict adequate water required by the fields and automatic pest identification based on the requirements of the farmland. K-Nearest Neighbour and support vector machine learning algorithms in the pest detection module are used to precisely predict plant diseases. The convenient features from the leaves of the plants were obtained. Then the obtained features are used for classification purposes. Extracting the suitable features and classifying them helps detect whether the plant is pest infected or not. The proposed system monitors, analyses, assesses and controls agricultural fields for the automatic irrigation of the water and disease identification of the plants. The numerical analysis of the machine learning algorithms and the significance of the classification with accuracy are investigated. From the numerical results, it is demonstrated that an accuracy of 84 \\\\% is achieved.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) into critical sectors such as industrial and manufacturing has resulted in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The IIoT consists of sensors, actuators, and smart devices that communicate with one another to optimize manufacturing and industrial processes. Although IIoT provides various benefits to both service providers and consumers, security and privacy remain a big challenge. An intrusion detection system (IDS) has been utilized to mitigate cyberattacks in such a connected network. However, many existing solutions for IDS in IIoT suffer from the lack of comprehensiveness of the types of attack the network is exposed to, high feature dimension, models built on out-of-date datasets, and a lack of focus on the problem of imbalanced datasets. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an intelligent detection system for identifying cyberattacks in Industrial IoT networks. The proposed model uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique to reduce data features and improve detection results. We use the synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE) technique to avoid over-fitting and under-fitting issues that result in biased classification. Several machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to classify data for binary and multi-class classification. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed intelligent model on ToN\\\\_IoT dataset. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy rate of 99.99\\\\% and a reduced error rate of 0.001\\\\% for binary classification, and an accuracy rate of 99.98\\\\% and a reduced error rate of 0.016\\\\% for multi-class classification.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture is one of the oldest occupations in the world and continues to exist today. In some form or another, the world’s population depends on agriculture for its needs. The major loss in sugarcane production in India is due to pests, plant disease, malnutrition, and nutrient deficiency in plants. To identify these diseases, farmers go to local farmers, experts, agricultural people, and fellow neighbors to identify the problem caused. In some cases, their information may be adequate, but in others it is not. These people cannot solve all the problems caused by their crops can be solved by these people; there is a need to accurately predict the correct disease and provide the proper treatment at the right time. This can only be done by applying machine learning-based Internet of Things solutions in real time. This article proposes a method for a smart farming system to address the needs of farmers producing sugarcane in India by applying intelligent solutions that use image processing and soft computing. Four sugarcane diseases are investigated, such as Eyespot, Leaf Scald, Yellow Leaf, and Pokkah Boeng, and three characteristics such as color, shape, and texture. Images were used for training data in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Neuro-Fuzzy, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) algorithms, and the performance of the feature extraction technique was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In the IoT and WSN era, large number of connected objects and sensing devices are dedicated to collect, transfer, and generate a huge amount of data for a wide variety of fields and applications. To effectively run these complex networks of connected objects, there are several challenges like topology changes, link failures, memory constraints, interoperability, network congestion, coverage, scalability, network management, security, and privacy to name a few. Thus, to overcome these challenges and exploiting them to support this technological outbreak would be one of the most crucial tasks of modern world. In the recent years, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) led to the emergence of Machine Learning (ML) which has become the key enabler to figure out solutions and learning models in an attempt to enhance the QoS parameters of IoT and WSNs. By learning from past experiences, ML techniques aim to resolve issues in the WSN and IoT's fields by building algorithmic models. In this paper, we are going to highlight the most fundamental concepts of ML categories and Algorithms. We start by providing a thorough overview of the WSN and IoT's technologies. We also discuss the vital role of ML techniques in driving up the evolution of these technologies. Then, as the key contribution of this paper, a new taxonomy of ML algorithms is provided. We also summarize the major applications and research challenges that leveraged ML techniques in the WSN and IoT. Eventually, we analyze the critical issues and list some future research directions.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become widely ubiquitous deployed in many application domains over the past few decades. Classical approaches configure WSNs statically which makes altering and re-configuring them dynamically a challenging task. To address this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could be integrated into WSNs. The utilization of AI systems holds the potential to enhance the efficient management of energy consumption, thereby preventing wastage and ensuring prolonged usage in WSN. This research investigates the application of AI, encompassing intelligent computing techniques such as Machine Learning, to promote sustainable energy practices, with a particular focus on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We explores various methodologies employed in AI, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning, within the context of existing practices. The primary objective is to provide insights for researchers seeking to comprehend recent advancements in employing AI for sustainable energy of WSNs. Additionally, the article addresses persistent challenges and issues that require attention and optimal solutions in this domain. As such, we provide an in-depth analysis of various recently proposed AI strategies (2007 to 2023) that have been applied to WSNs. The examined articles have been systematically arranged to enhance follow-through, clarity, and readability. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the (AI) techniques employed in WSNs. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities that would enable scalable and cost-effective AI deployment in WSNs.',\n",

AI deals with the creation of systems that can learn to mimic human functions, using their previous experience and without any manual intervention. AI refers to analytical methods in the execution of certain tasks, which can replace human intelligence. AI helps computers to learn from experience, adapts to new inputs, and performs tasks of a human nature. From research labs to your living room, AI now lives everywhere.

       "  'abstract': 'Although the reception of Internet of Things (IoT) services increased efficiency and allowed companies to automate the production through remote and intelligent control, it also increases the risk of potential threats and security attacks. The attackers can compromise the security of the IoT node and join it to a botnet, manipulate sensitive data or take control of a full network. Securing the IoT nodes from security attacks remains a challenge, especially under the multiple attack models where several attacks can be launched simultaneously. The objective of this paper is to prevent a type of multiple attacks that are the foundation to manipulate sensor nodes’ data that are: clone attack, tamper attack, false data injection, node malfunctioning, and physical layer attack. A solution is proposed to secure the IoT nodes against these attacks. The proposed solution is based on a novel sensor pairing approach to evaluate the trustworthiness of IoT nodes’ sensor data using multiple machine learning models. In particular, we propose a threat model and the pairing algorithm to pair each sensor node with the sensor node located in the neighbor. We compare the performance of three machine learning models, which are decision tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) by using two publically available real-world datasets in terms of attack detection accuracy, training time, and testing time. Our proposed system achieved up to 100\\\\% accuracy rate and nearly twice faster training and testing time as compared to the existing solutions. We provide the memory and energy consumption analysis to show that the proposed method has lower communication and memory overhead on IoT nodes than previous solutions against IoT security attacks. Our dataset just contains the data of a pair of sensors and is reduced up to eight times smaller in size than the actual dataset.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Traditional agriculture has been the pillar of development on the planet for centuries. But with exponential population growth and increasing demand, farmers will need water to irrigate the land to meet this demand. Because of the scarcity of this resource, farmers need a solution that changes the way they operate. With the advent of new technologies, the notion of Agriculture 4.0 has become a reality to keep up with and meet the demand. With the addition of artificial intelligence and IoT through the collection and processing of agricultural data, decisions have become more and more precise to facilitate decision-making. This paper proposes an intelligent and flexible irrigation approach with low consumption and cost that can be deployed in different contexts. This approach is based on machine learning algorithms for smart agriculture. For this, we used a set of sensors (soil humidity, temperature, and rain) in an environment that ensures better plant growth for months, from which we collected data based on an acquisition map using the Node-RED platform and MongoDB. We used many different models based on the collected data: KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, and Naïve Bayes. The results showed that K-Nearest Neighbors is better with a recognition rate of 98.3\\\\% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12, compared to other models (LR, NN, SVM, NB). and towards the end, we provided a web application that brings together the various data emitted by the sensors as well as the prediction of our models to allow better visualization and supervision of our environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Iraq’s population will have reached 50 million by 2030, according to the Ministry of Planning. This population growth must be handled by ensuring food security stability in the face of expected obstacles resulting from global warming. The agricultural sector encounters limitations due to ineffective detection of persistent agricultural obstacles like pathogens, flawed soil analysis, insect infestations, inadequate irrigation, and drainage. More proven farming strategies must be transferred using modern technological leaps from this vantage point. It is clear from the outset that this paper aims to discuss how artificial intelligence might aid in the growth of conventional methods in agriculture. This involves tracking and guiding each stage of agriculture through the adoption of an intelligent system, which in turn includes managing a set of intelligent systems that control and supervise the rest of the processes (System of Systems or SoS), beginning with ploughing, crop pattern, type of fertilizer, and the appropriate type of irrigation. On the other hand, this technology collection could give farmers an accurate view of market trends and customer preferences, resulting in greater output. This paper gives an insight into the concept of a SoS and the application of artificial intelligence in various fields of agricultural engineering in Iraq. It also proposes an intelligence framework model for self-cultivation and incorporates competitive strategies to develop a decent ecosystem to transform traditional agriculture into smart and accurate agriculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Sustainability is a major challenge in agri-food systems. Digital technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) hold substantial promises for attaining the sustainability goals of the economy, environment and society at large. However, in practice it is difficult to evaluate to which extent these technologies contribute to sustainable development raising doubts about their impact. This paper demonstrates a stepwise approach that allows for measuring and monitoring IoT contribution to sustainability in a real-life context. The UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) underpin the principles of the approach by a typology and by framing the sustainability impact in terms of business opportunities. The approach has been developed and evaluated by 33 use cases in the EU-funded IoF2020 project. The research illustrates how the measurement and monitoring tool is applied in 5 of these use cases from different agricultural subsectors showing how the approach is applied and validated. The results indicate an overall positive impact of IoT on improving sustainability, although these results are also partly determined by other influential external factors that cannot be easily discerned in a practical situation. The main contribution of this approach is the set of instruments for practitioners to measure and monitor the impact of fast-changing technologies such as IoT to sustainability in a real-life context. This set of instruments can also be used by other stakeholders in large IoT projects where strategic sustainability objectives should be supported by IoT solutions. The stepwise approach is easy to communicate and supports stakeholders such as farmers in decision-making, but also policy makers and investors in funding projects.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The present study analyzed the trends in patenting in the field of Precision Agriculture (PA) since the late 1970s, when the potential application of microprocessor‐based technology started to show its dramatic effects on agriculture. The patenting activities analyses conducted focused as first on the evolution of the terms that historically have been used to indicate the common principles linked to the concept of precision agriculture, to mine relevant keywords within massive datasets such as patent documents. Then, the rationale was to impose a sorting approach based on different criteria: (i) field of application (Positioning and Guidance Technologies; Information and Communication Technologies ICT; Measuring Technologies; Reacting Technologies); (ii) sensory technology (Positioning; Optical; Electro-chemical; Mechanical); and (iii) farming practices (Sowing; Fertilization; Protection; Irrigation; Harvest). The number of grants collected included 2003 results, with an enormous increase in the number of precision agriculture-related patents registered in the last years. This study emphasizes the central role of ICT and Global Positioning technologies in supporting several measuring and response technologies, highlights the increasing relevance of environmental sensors and image devices, notes the rise of unmanned vehicles in agricultural patents, and underscores fertilization as a dominant subject for patent activity among the farming practices.',\n",

This management strategy is underpinned by various advanced technologies including Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensing systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI) perception algorithms. In particular, due to their unique advantages such as a low cost, high spatio-temporal resolutions, flexibility, automation functions and minimized risk of operation, UAV sensing systems have been extensively applied in many civilian applications including PA since 2010. In parallel, AI algorithms (deep learning since 2012 in particular) are also drawing ever-increasing attention in different fields, since they are able to analyse an unprecedented volume/velocity/variety of data (semi-) automatically, which are also becoming computationally practical with the advancements of cloud computing, Graphics Processing Units and parallel computing. In this survey paper, therefore, a thorough review is performed on recent use of UAV sensing systems (e.g., UAV platforms, external sensing units) and AI algorithms (mainly supervised learning algorithms) in PA applications throughout the crop life-cycle, as well as the challenges and prospects for future development of UAVs and AI in agriculture sector. It is envisioned that this review is able to provide a timely technical reference, demystifying and promoting research, deployment and successful exploitation of AI empowered UAV perception systems for PA, and therefore contributing to addressing future agricultural and human nutrition challenges.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, the development of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has increased, resulting in higher demands for sufficient bandwidth, data rates, latency, and quality of service (QoS). In advanced communications, managing network resources for allocating IoT services and identifying the exact IoT devices connected to a network is a major concern. The existing studies have introduced various methods for classifying IoT devices in a network. However, the previous studies faced challenges like limited attributes, low efficiency, inappropriate features, and computational complexities. Also, the existing studies failed to concentrate on IoT/Non-IoT classification along with attack detection. Detecting attacks on IoT devices is critical for making network services more effective. Thus, the proposed study introduces an efficient IoT device classification and attack detection mechanism using Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled Fiber-Wireless Access Networks Internet of Things (FiWi IoT) architecture. Initially, an effective resource allocation process is performed to mitigate the delay constraint issues by introducing a hybrid parallel neural network-based dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) method. Then, the input traffic information is gathered from the resource-efficient SDN-enabled FiWi IoT network, and the input data is pre-processed to eliminate unwanted noises using min-max normalization and standardization. Next, the essential attributes are extracted to attain enhanced classification performance. To reduce the feature dimensionality problem and thereby solve complexity issues, the most optimal features are selected by a new Chaotic Seagull Optimization (CSO) approach. After that, IoT/non-IoT classification is performed using a transformer-driven deep intelligent model. Finally, the attacks are detected and classified by introducing a novel Slice Attention-based Deep Capsule Autoencoder (SA\\\\_DCAE) model. For experimentation, the Python 3.7.0 tool is used in this work, and the performance of proposed classifiers is measured by evaluating varied matrices. Also, the comparison analysis proves the superiority of the proposed techniques to other existing methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been extensively applied in farming recently. To cultivate healthier crops, manage pests, monitor soil and growing conditions, analyse data for farmers, and enhance other management activities of the food supply chain, the agriculture sector is turning to AI technology. It makes it challenging for farmers to choose the ideal time to plant seeds. AI helps farmers choose the optimum seed for a particular weather scenario. It also offers data on weather forecasts. AI-powered solutions will help farmers produce more with fewer resources, increase crop quality, and hasten product time to reach the market. AI aids in understanding soil qualities. AI helps farmers by suggesting the nutrients they should apply to increase the quality of the soil. AI can help farmers choose the optimal time to plant their seeds. Intelligent equipment can calculate the spacing between seeds and the maximum planting depth. An AI-powered system known as a health monitoring system provides farmers with information on the health of their crops and the nutrients that need to be given to enhance yield quality and quantity. This study identifies and analyses relevant articles on AI for Agriculture.

       "  'abstract': \"The ongoing depopulation of rural areas and the increasing demand for high-quality food, along with the need to improve the quality of work in terms of stress, injuries, and social disputes, needs significant attention towards rethinking and organizing agricultural practices to meet these needs and improve the quality of life. These changes call for the implementation of new reforms, incentive systems, and the exploration of innovative systems for field operations. In this context, the research, design, and commercialization of electrified autonomous and collaborative systems capable of precision agriculture applications, known as agribots, are gaining paramount importance. This article presents an innovative multi-robot for smart farming. The agribot is composed by a lightweight cart designed to traverse crop field rows through a cable-way system installed on two heavy carts equipped with a power train system and PV rooftop panels. The agribot is conceived to achieve a high level of autonomy, reduce energy consumption, and minimize soil compaction while working on flat fields with low-height crops. The article is structured in two parts: the first part describes the agribot's ICT network, the heavy carts electric grid and the power systems, providing an energy consumption analysis related to the traversing of a crop field row. The second part focuses on the control, actions coordination, and supervision system (supervisor), implemented using Robot Operating System (ROS). The supervisor system, driven by a decision-making system based on a finite state machine, oversees the execution of path planning for the agribot, providing high modularity and flexibility to adapt to various system actions.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Both Internet of Things (IoT) and Software Defined Networks (SDN) have a major role in increasing efficiency and productivity for smart cities. Despite that, they face potential security threats that need to be reduced. A new Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has become necessary to secure them. Many researchers have recently used recent techniques such as machine learning to analyze and identify the rapid growth of attacks and abnormal behavior. Most of these techniques have low accuracy and less scalability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Secured Automatic Two-level Intrusion Detection System (SATIDS) based on an improved Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The proposed system differentiates between attack and benign traffic, identifies the attack category, and defines the type of sub-attack with high performance. To prove the efficiency of the proposed system, it was trained and evaluated using two of the most recent realistic datasets; ToN-IoT and InSDN datasets. Its performance was analyzed and compared to other IDSs. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms others in detecting many types of attacks. It achieves 96.35 \\\\% accuracy, 96 \\\\% detection rate, and 98.4 \\\\% precision for ToN-IoT dataset.

       "  'abstract': \"Agriculture remains one of the most important concerns for sustainable livelihood and employment. Precision Agriculture (PA) offers a sustainable management solution to meet the increasingly high demand of food and raw materials. PA is also believed to increase safety of the environment, reduce climate change effects, and improve food security. Farmers need to make timely decisions throughout the agricultural life cycle, that is, from paddock to plate. Crop management (from sowing till harvesting) is an important component of this cycle and needs apt decision by the farmers. Such decisions must be timely and precise, for example, how much of weedicide needs to be sprayed and where exactly in the fields it is needed. Geospatial technologies assist in identifying variabilities in soil, weather, water, and crop performance. These are important crop limiting factors and need to be addressed through various management operations. Geospatial technologies in combination with Internet of Things (IoT) guides farmers not only to identify these factors but also provide support in making optimal decisions. This process makes agriculture a digital entity and thus provides considerable information about the land characteristics of individual farms. Remotely sensed imagery is frequently used for mapping agricultural land use, crop yield prediction, and stress monitoring. Remote and in-situ sensors have been developed and used for mapping and monitoring of soil and water characteristics such as electrical conductivity, soil moisture, and microclimate of plants. This information is transformed into knowledge through using machine learning techniques. The potential of these machine learning techniques to monitor various types of crop stresses has been explored to a large extent during past 10 years and more recently deep learning techniques are being developed owing to the rapid advancements in computing capabilities. This chapter, firstly, introduces the need of PA in response to economic and environmental impacts of increased food production to feed about eight billion people. While introducing its need, we argue that PA needs to be adopted as a management philosophy. Secondly, enabling geospatial technologies including Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) has been discussed in relation to their utility in PA. After giving the reader an idea about the magnitude of data obtained using GIS and RS techniques, big data analytics have been presented to show its potential for operationalizing PA. Thirdly, a state-of-the-art conceptual system of PA is described along with the practical use of geospatial technologies for its various components with practical examples from Australian Center for International Agriculture Research's (ACIAR) funded projects. However, the user can be doubtful when it comes to data sharing. Lastly, survey results have been shared with the readers to apprise them of the use of technology in agriculture relevant to PA components.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The digitisation of agriculture, integral to Agriculture 4.0, has brought significant benefits while simultaneously escalating cybersecurity risks. With the rapid adoption of smart farming technologies and infrastructure, the agricultural sector has become an attractive target for cyberattacks. This paper presents a systematic literature review that assesses the applicability of existing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) techniques within smart farming infrastructures (SFIs). We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Our research underscores the importance of integrating a vCISO framework into smart farming practices as a vital step towards strengthening cybersecurity. This is essential for protecting the agriculture sector in the era of digital transformation, ensuring the resilience and sustainability of the food supply chain against emerging cyber risks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Rice is a very essential food for the survival of human society. Most of the people focus on production of rice for their financial gain as well as their survival in the society. Rice production means a lot, not only for the farmers, but also for the entire human society However, it is very difficult to protect the rice during and after the production due to several reasons, such as natural calamities, heavy rain fall, flood, earthquakes, damage of rice due to pests, etc. Damage of rice can occur during production and after the production due to several pests. So, it is very much essential to identify the pests in the rice so that preventive measures can be taken for its protection. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT) assisted Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based rice pest detection model using Imagga cloud is proposed to identify the pests in the rice during its production in the field. The IoT assisted UAV focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) mechanism and Python programming paradigm for sending the rice pest images to the Imagga cloud and providing the pest information. The Imagga cloud detects the pest by finding the confidence values with the tags. The tag represents the object in that image. The tag with maximum confidence value and beyond threshold is selected as the target tag to identify the pest. If pest is detected then the information is sent to the owner for further actions. The proposed method can able to identify any kind of the pest that affects the rice during production.

       "  'abstract': 'Precision agriculture generates large datasets from IoT infrastructures deployed for continuous crop monitoring. This data requires analysis to usefully transform this data deluge into insights that can deliver value-generating services to farmers in a timely manner. This paper introduces SEPARATE; a dynamic interoperable and decentralized infrastructure for executing both, training and inference stages of deep learning (DL) algorithms in smart agriculture scenarios. The presented infrastructure allows the execution of the inference stage at the edge, achieving a highly efficient and responsive local temperature prediction service to take actions based on the predictions generated. Moreover, the training stage is offloaded to the cloud along with the generated historical data, allowing the trained model to be periodically updated at the edge. On the one hand, our results show that the Convolutional Neural Network model together with the Long Short-Term Memory technique (CNNLSTM) obtains the best results in both prediction accuracy and computational time. On the other hand, an analysis has been carried out to determine how often the model must be retrained, obtaining results that indicate that from day 9–10, it would be necessary to retrain the model, although, until day 20, the precision is not greatly reduced. Moreover, the SEPARATE infrastructure enables the execution of real-time inference from sensor-generated data and seamless model retraining in an operational greenhouse for temperature forecast with satisfactory performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Applying artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data to natural resource management (NRM) is revolutionizing how natural resources are managed. To gain more insights into the domain, we use 394 Scopus-indexed documents to explore the thematic evolution and explore future research directions. We found that the topics related to AI, ML, and big data for natural resource management have increased significantly since 2012. While “Remote Sensing” is the most productive journal, S. Alqadhi and J. Mallick are the most contributing authors, and the United States has been the most contributing country. While the keywords “sustainable development” and “remote sensing” have been growing steadily since 1975, “natural resource modeling” and “machine learning” have been more popular during the last few years. The thematic analysis reveals that the existing literature is concentrated around four clusters, and the content analysis of the clusters uncovers 15 future research agendas. These research agendas include the development of efficient strategies for NRM, understanding the role of AI and ML in natural resource management, leveraging data-driven methods for decision-making, and developing models for interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches. The study provides important implications of using technology in NRM. These technologies help policymakers create effective policies, improves assessment and decision-making, and optimizes resource use. These advancements benefit society by increasing access to essential resources in a fair manner, and they have positive impacts on both the public and private sectors, enabling evidence-based policymaking and responsible resource extraction. Collaboration and investment in these technologies are crucial for achieving sustainable development and preserving natural resources for future generations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Agri-Food sector is in a stressful situation due to the high demand for food from the growing population around the world. The agricultural sector is facing a challenging situation; it must increase production and reduce its impact on the environment by appropriately allocating resources, adapting to climate change, and avoiding food waste. Agriculture 5.0, as the fifth agricultural evolution, aims to offer a perfect symbiosis between agriculture, advanced technologies, and sustainability. The most advanced technologies in automation, monitoring, and decision support are driven by the collection and processing of large volumes of agricultural data, such as weather information, farm machinery, soil and crop conditions, and marketing demand for higher profits. Taking advantage of the technological paradigm of the Internet of Things, agricultural data provides information on spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. Spatio-temporal semantic data management systems have become the cornerstone for the achievement of Agriculture 5.0 through advanced Internet of Things technologies. This paper aims to review the current literature on spatio-temporal semantic data management systems for Agriculture 5.0. This paper uses a systematic literature review technique to study eleven representative spatio-temporal semantic data management systems. A comprehensive evaluation of the aspects of interoperability, accessibility, scalability, real-time operation capability, etc. is carried out. Based on the evaluation results, future challenges are detected and development trends and possible improvements are proposed for future research. Finally, a distributed architecture capable of satisfying the above needs and challenges is proposed. The paper aims to inspire further research and development efforts to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and performance of spatio-temporal semantic data management systems.',\n",

Various researches and analysis have been conducted and numerous methods have been incorporated to apply IoT technology on agronomical fields. IoT can play a vital role in timely detection of declining plant health so that appropriate measures can be taken. It is a huge step towards smart agriculture. In this paper we propose a model to build up an automated framework which will recognize the crop decay in the initial phase which is imperceptible to naked human eyes. This model helps in prevention of huge losses and also save a lot of time and labor. The proposed model builds a recognition framework using sensors like humidity, moisture, temperature and color of the plant leaf. The data from the sensors is sent to Arduino to Cloud which then analyzes the data and helps in identifying the plant decay. In the upcoming years, the internet of things will be a crucial bit in the smart farming system.',\n",

However, IoT systems are susceptible to faults due to hardware, firmware, or software failures, which can interfere with their proper functioning in real-life environments. To ensure fault-free automation of IoT systems, it is important to implement a proactive maintenance strategy that uses deep learning techniques to forecast failures in smart home applications by analyzing each device’s log of events and calculating its failure rate per attempt. This will help service providers and connected devices extend better serviceability of the system while assisting management in making timely decisions. Additionally, the system’s early prediction feature alerts consumers to take necessary actions when devices behave unexpectedly. The performance evaluation of the proposed predictive system using Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting upcoming failures in smart home applications. Bi-LSTM has a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 36.99, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 6.082, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.305, while GRU has an MSE of 26.081, RMSE of 5.106, and MAE of 4.282.',\n",

This platform is established on the basis of precision agriculture and wireless sensor network work, and analyzes the accuracy of various types of light wavelengths for determining wheat rust. The analysis results show that the accuracy of light with multiple wavelengths is not necessarily better than the light with a single wavelength. The accuracy of 600 nm wavelength can reach 100 \\\\%, and the accuracy of monitoring with 4 wavelengths together is rather low. However, less consideration is given to the factors in this article, and wheat does not necessarily cause only one disease. Comprehensive analysis is required.

One of these important effects on low crop yields is diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and viruses. This can be prevented and handled by means of applying plant disease detection approaches. Machine learning techniques will be employed in the process of disease identification on plants as it mostly applies information themselves and offers fabulous techniques for detection of plant diseases. Methods based on Machine learning can be employed for the identification of diseases because it mainly applies on data superiority outcomes for specified task. In this approach, a comprehensive review has been made on the various techniques employed in plant disease detection using artificial intelligence (AI) based machine learning and deep learning techniques. Likewise, deep learning has also gained a great deal of significance in offering better performance outcome for detecting plant disease in the computer vision field. The deep learning advancements were employed to a range of domains that leads to great attainment in the machine learning and computer vision areas. The comparative study is made in terms of machine and deep learning techniques and their performance and usage in various research papers is related to show the effectiveness of deep learning model over machine learning model.

A smart agriculture refers to all sorts of developments related to farming to marking or distribution and reaching the end user without any wastage. The use of today’s advanced technology gives us increased productivity in optimized resource uses. That is possible if the farmer cultivates in a controlled and transparent way. A smart farm is an example of facilitating sustainable agricultural productivity increases. This coupled with decreasing common assets, restricted accessibility of arable land, and increments in flighty climate conditions make food security a significant worry for most nations. Thus, the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics (DA) are used to upgrade the operational effectiveness and profitability in horticulture. It not only gives importance to increased productivity, but it also emphasizes environmental sustainability along with features of data analytics, where the task is to find requirements and predict the suitability of a crop. There is a change in outlook from the utilization of wireless sensor networks (WSN) as a significant driver of shrewd agribusiness to the utilization of IoT and DA. The IoT coordinates a few existing advances, such as WSN, radio recurrence ID, distributed computing, middleware frameworks, and end client applications.

In this study, growth data from three different rice cultivars at two different climate regions in Taiwan were used to calculate the rice growth rate (Gr) in key growth stages. A total of 10,246 Gr data from 95 cultivations were used to assess the feasibility of simulating rice growth rate from ambient temperature by regression algorithm (REG), artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene-expression programming (GEP). Simulation was carried out for each algorithm using ambient temperature and growing season as input variables for the entire life cycle of rice (Trall) either as one continuous growth period or as the sum of four distinctive growth stages (Tr1 4). The results showed that the model output from Tr1 4 are more accurate than Trall. However, simulation errors in the transitional stages occurred when the growth rate at different stages was modelled separately. Artificial intelligence based nonlinear models were more accurate than the regression model and ANN generally exhibited better performance than other two models. Compared with REG, the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of averaged error-in-days for the whole growth period decreased by 41.38\\\\% and 42.81\\\\% in ANN and 30.14\\\\%, and 31.21\\\\% in GEP.

       "  'abstract': \"With the growth of data generation speed and its huge volume, the cloud-based infrastructure alone does not meet the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT), thereby leading to inefficiency. By combining fog and cloud computing on the IoT, some processing occurs near the data generation location with a higher speed and without needing a large bandwidth. Cloud and fog computing requires proper management in scheduling, increasing resource efficiency, and reducing consumption costs. In this article, a two-phase scheduling algorithm is presented based on deep learning methods in the field of IoT. The first phase is to decide on the location of the task execution using the clustering method. The second phase involves scheduling the task according to the execution location. In the clustering section, three ideas based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering method have been proposed. In the first and second ideas, the SOM and hierarchical SOM are used to cluster the features of the tasks received from the IoT layer. In the third idea, the feature is extracted, and its dimensions are reduced using the Autoencoder, which is one of the deep learning methods, after which clustering is done. After scheduling each cluster's tasks, comparing the methods presented in the article, it is shown that the feature extraction using deep learning can improve clustering in such a way to reduce the missed rate of tasks in the cloud and fog, as well as their costs.\",\n",

A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, the fog needs to send a high volume of data to the cloud and this can cause link congestion with unusable data traffic. Here we propose an approach to collect and store data in a fog-based smart agriculture environment and different data reduction methods. Sixteen techniques for data reduction are investigated; eight machine learning (ML) methods combined with run-length encoding, and eight combined with Huffman encoding. Our experiment uses two real data sets, where the first contains air temperature and humidity values, and the second has soil moisture and temperature conditions. The fog filters cluster the unlabelled data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms that group data into categories according to their value ranges in all experiments. Supervised learning classification methods are also used to predict the class of data samples from these categories. After that, the fog filter compresses the identified categories using two data compression techniques, run-length encoding (RLE) and the Huffman encoding, preserving the data time series nature. Our results reveal that a k-means combined with RLE method achieved the highest reduction, where the fog needed to store and transmit only 3\\\\%–6\\\\% of the original data generated by sensors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The exponential growth in adopting Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services has rendered IoT security an essential concern that must be handled promptly. Multi-vector Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are more intensified forms of DDoS attacks, and the anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) schemes are the best suitable for detecting and mitigating them. However, deploying anomaly-based IDS frameworks in healthcare systems is particularly difficult since it involves longer processing times, increased complexity, and the need to preserve temporal features. This study presents a novel anomaly-based IDS framework that utilizes proposed stacked modified Gated Recurrent Units (mGRU) to detect and identify the Multi-vector DDoS attacks in mobile healthcare informatics systems. In order to generate user-specific results, we have developed two instances of IDS, namely the Binary Classification Engine (BCE) and the Multi-label Classification Engine (MCE). The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed mGRU-based IDS models outperform the standard GRU-based IDS models, with a reduction in time consumption of around 2\\\\% on the CICIoT2023 and CICDDoS2019 datasets. The proposed IDS instances provide leading-edge metrics, lightweight features, and user-specific results, making them suitable for effective deployment in time-critical healthcare applications and services.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent times, the machine learning (ML) community has recognized the deep learning (DL) computing model as the Gold Standard. DL has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of machine learning, achieving remarkable results in various complex cognitive tasks that are comparable to, or even surpassing human performance. One of the key benefits of DL is its ability to learn from vast amounts of data. In recent years, the DL field has witnessed rapid expansion and has found successful applications in various conventional areas. Significantly, DL has outperformed established ML techniques in multiple domains, such as cloud computing, robotics, cybersecurity, and several others. Nowadays, cloud computing has become crucial owing to the constant growth of the IoT network. It remains the finest approach for putting sophisticated computational applications into use, stressing the huge data processing. Nevertheless, the cloud falls short because of the crucial limitations of cutting-edge IoT applications that produce enormous amounts of data and necessitate a quick reaction time with increased privacy. The latest trend is to adopt a decentralized distributed architecture and transfer processing and storage resources to the network edge. This eliminates the bottleneck of cloud computing as it places data processing and analytics closer to the consumer. Machine learning (ML) is being increasingly utilized at the network edge to strengthen computer programs, specifically by reducing latency and energy consumption while enhancing resource management and security. To achieve optimal outcomes in terms of efficiency, space, reliability, and safety with minimal power usage, intensive research is needed to develop and apply machine learning algorithms. This comprehensive examination of prevalent computing paradigms underscores recent advancements resulting from the integration of machine learning and emerging computing models, while also addressing the underlying open research issues along with potential future directions. Because it is thought to open up new opportunities for both interdisciplinary research and commercial applications, we present a thorough assessment of the most recent works involving the convergence of deep learning with various computing paradigms, including cloud, fog, edge, and IoT, in this contribution. We also draw attention to the main issues and possible future lines of research. We hope this survey will spur additional study and contributions in this exciting area.',\n",

This research paper proposes an innovative ML-enabled IoT device to monitor soil nutrients and provide accurate crop recommendations. The device utilizes the FC-28 sensor, DHT11 sensor, and JXBS-3001 sensor to collect real-time data on soil composition, moisture, humidity, temperature, and for nutrient levels. The collected data is transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze the collected data and generate customized recommendations, including a possible high-yielding crop list, fertilizer names, and its amount based on crop requirements and soil nutrients. Furthermore, the applied fertilizers and treatments to the field during production are stored in the database. As a result, it has become possible to determine the quality of the produce at the consumer level through the mobile app. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through field experiments, comparing its performance with traditional methods. The results demonstrate the device's ability to enhance crop productivity and optimize resource utilization, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and food security.

Microalgae-based wastewater treatment has resulted in a paradigm shift in our approach toward nutrient removal and simultaneous resource recovery from wastewater. Wastewater treatment and the generation of biofuels and bioproducts from microalgae can be coupled to promote the circular economy synergistically. A microalgal biorefinery transforms microalgal biomass into biofuels, bioactive chemicals, and biomaterials. The large-scale cultivation of microalgae is essential for the commercialization and industrialization of microalgae biorefinery. However, the inherent complexity of microalgal cultivation parameters regarding physiological and illumination parameters renders it challenging to facilitate a smooth and cost-effective operation. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning algorithms (MLA) offer innovative strategies for assessing, predicting, and regulating uncertainties in algal wastewater treatment and biorefinery. The current study presents a critical review of the most promising AI/MLAs that demonstrate a potential to be applied in microalgal technologies. The most commonly used MLAs include artificial neural networks, support vector machine, genetic algorithms, decision tree, and random forest algorithms. Recent developments in AI have made it possible to combine cutting-edge techniques from AI research fields with microalgae for accurate analysis of large datasets. MLAs have been extensively studied for their potential in microalgae detection and classification. However, the ML application in microalgal industries, such as optimizing microalgae cultivation for increased biomass productivity, is still in its infancy. Incorporating smart AI/ML-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) based technologies can help the microalgal industries to operate effectively with minimum resources.

       "  'abstract': 'Image motion deblurring is a crucial technology in computer vision that has gained significant attention attracted by its outstanding ability for accurate acquisition of motion image information, processing and intelligent decision making, etc. Motion blur has recently been considered as one of the major challenges for applications of computer vision in precision agriculture. Motion blurred images seriously affect the accuracy of information acquisition in precision agriculture scene image such as testing, tracking, and behavior analysis of animals, recognition of plant phenotype, critical characteristics of pests and diseases, etc. On the other hand, the fast motion and irregular deformation of agriculture livings, and motion of image capture device all introduce great challenges for image motion deblurring. Hence, the demand of more efficient image motion deblurring method is rapidly increasing and developing in the applications with dynamic scene. Up till now, some studies have been carried out to address this challenge, e.g., spatial motion blur, multi-scale blur and other types of blur. This paper starts with categorization of causes of image blur in precision agriculture. Then, it gives detail introduction of general-purpose motion deblurring methods and their the strengthen and weakness. Furthermore, these methods are compared for the specific applications in precision agriculture e.g., detection and tracking of livestock animal, harvest sorting and grading, and plant disease detection and phenotyping identification etc. Finally, future research directions are discussed to push forward the research and application of advancing in precision agriculture image motion deblurring field.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Groundwater is a crucial resource for fulfilling the water requirements of India's rural and urban areas. The heterogeneous nature of geological, hydrological, and climatic factors results in substantial variability in the accessibility of groundwater across disparate regions. The present investigation centers on the cartography of groundwater accessibility in arid zones of rural and urban Indian areas using a Deep Learning Classification Model (DL-GWCM) supported by the Internet of Things (IoT). The introductory section underscores the importance of groundwater in India, where groundwater sources cater to around 80\\\\% of rural and 50\\\\% of urban water demands. The text highlights statistical data derived from surveys that indicate a notable decrease in groundwater levels. This underscores the pressing necessity for implementing effective monitoring and management strategies. The DL-GWCM is a proposed solution that aims to enhance the precision and effectiveness of groundwater availability mapping by incorporating IoT technology and Deep Learning Classification. The DL-GWCM comprises multiple constituent elements, such as Groundwater Prediction, Water Quality Index, and Conventional Neural Network- Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN–Bi LSTM) classification. The process of Groundwater Prediction involves the utilization of past data and environmental factors to make precise forecasts of groundwater levels. The Water Quality Index evaluates the quality of subsurface water resources, guaranteeing their secure and enduring utilization. The Deep Learning Classification Model with IoT technology was implemented for groundwater accessibility mapping in Indian arid zones. It integrates Groundwater Prediction, Water Quality Index, and CNN–Bi LSTM classification. The model makes precise forecasts using past data and environmental factors, ensuring secure water quality. Using the CNN–Bi LSTM classification model improves the precision of groundwater availability mapping due to its resilient classification capabilities. These findings suggest that the DL-GWCM outperforms conventional approaches. The mean values of all five metrics for the proposed method are presented as follows: The performance metrics of the model are as follows: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.77\\\\%, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.13\\\\%, Relative Absolute Error (RAE) of 8.72\\\\%, Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE) of 0.92\\\\%, and Correlation Coefficient (CC) of 0.92. The results of the proposed methodology facilitate the discernment of regions with abundant or scarce groundwater accessibility, thereby supporting the sustainable management and planning of groundwater resources.\",\n",

Moreover, an intelligent anti-frost irrigation management system is presented. The climatological station and the ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation interact with the environmental system through a website, allowing the real time interconnection, acquisition and monitoring of information through mobile phone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. The system is self-sustaining through the use of solar panels. The ANN could be used to optimally predict the inside temperature of greenhouses and a Fuzzy Expert System (FES) controls the activation of a water pump. The ANN input variables involve the relative humidity, temperature of outside air, solar radiation, wind speed and inside air relative humidity. The fuzzy control and ANN allows the prediction of the internal temperature of the greenhouse and the cropland temperature, which are used to activate the anti-frost water distribution system. The ANN models give a temperature prediction through the coefficient of determination of variance analysis (ANOVA) method. The R2 values for temperature in summer season were 90.23, and 91.30; and for the winter season were 94.28, and 95.22, respectively. The fuzzy associative memory (FAM) controls the activation of the anti-frost irrigation system with five outputs for controlling the climatological frost presence: No-frost (NF), Possible-frost (PF), Mild-frost (MF), Severe-frost (SF) and Hard-frost (HF).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision agriculture (PA) relies on a large amount of precise data about a given area and allows that data to be used in accordance with agronomic practices. It offers farmers greater control over existing processes, from crop placement to soil conditions to chemical use. On the other hand, applying precision livestock solutions to these expanding systems is a way to bring animals closer to producers and minimize waste and costs. In Europe, precision agriculture has emerged as a new way to help farmers increase the quantity and quality of agricultural production while using fewer inputs. The spatial and temporal variability in the application of PA and the implications of site-specific application are documented in this article. The objective of this review article is to provide an overview of the application of precision agriculture in Central European countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Germany, and Hungary) identified through a systematic literature review (SLR). The analyses revealed that with the rapid development of automation in agriculture, the demand for skilled workers will continue to increase and technology will continue to open up new application areas as well as the development of new AgriTech startups in the future. Currently, there are farmers in Germany and the Czech Republic who are leaders in the use of these technologies.

Three sectors in agriculture are scrutinized: arable farming, milk production and beef production. As a foundation for the project, a literature review revises former research on smart farming. Thereafter, an interview study with 21 respondents both explores the susceptibility and maturity of smart farming technologies and provides technical depth to three chosen applications of AI in agriculture. Although the focus of the study is on the Swedish context, the findings can be generalized to the European agricultural sector and even world-wide. Findings of the study include a diverse set of aspects that both enable and obstruct the transition. Main identified opportunities are the importance smart farming has on the strategic agendas of several industry stakeholders, the general trend towards software technology as a service through shared machinery, the vast amount of existing data, and the large interest from farmers towards new technology. Contrasting, the study identifies main hurdles as technical and legislative challenges to data ownership, potential cybersecurity threats, the need for a well-articulated business case, and the sometimes lacking technical knowledge within the sector. The paper concludes that the macro trend points towards a smart farming transition but that the speed of the transformation will depend on the resolutions for the identified obstacles.',\n",

Manually collecting samples and sending them to a research center for discovery and analysis is the typical approach for gathering information on water qualities. However, this approach is illogical in the long run because it requires a lot of time and labor. This paper aimed to construct, test, and evaluate the usefulness of machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) at water storage stations. First, we developed a system prototype and assessed its performance using classifier and reliability matrices. This study considers water's physical and chemical parameters to evaluate the level of water pollutants present in drinking water. The parameters measured include temperature, pH, turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP), and electrical conductivity. After analyzing the sensor data, we used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithms to forecast the impurity level of the water measured. The performance showed that the ANN models used have the highest accuracy and are the most suitable to predict water source and status. We also introduced a water treatment method to provide an automated corrective measure based on a specific amount of water contamination. Based on the system's results, we concluded that AI and IoT are more efficient in remotely monitoring safe and harmful water conditions.\",\n",

Data poising attacks are very serious concerns because they may play a significant factor for businesses and organizations for both financial terms and damaging their reputations, when the Big data analytics on the analyzed data is itself corrupted. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we suggest a blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence(AI)/Machine Learning(ML)-enabled Big data analytics mechanism for CIoT environment. The comprehensive experimental results have been provided under two circumstances: (1) performance of the ML model under data poisoning attacks and (2) performance of the ML model without data poisoning attacks. In the first case, we show how the data poison attacks can effect the ML model when the data is on some cloud storage (i.e. not in the blockchains), whereas in the second case we show the effect when the data is in the blockchains (i.e., without data poisoning attacks). The experimental results demonstrate that we have significant gains in performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score when there are no data poisoning attacks on the data. Moreover, a detailed blockchain simulation has carried out to demonstrate the practical aspects of the proposed security framework.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The most amount of withdrawn freshwater in the world is used for agriculture activities to extract essential products for human survival. Smart Farming can manage and optimize the water amount given to crop fields in various crop development stages, weather, and soil condition. Sensors installed in several monitoring spots can gather soil moisture of the crop field to indicate the level of water retained in it. However, due to connectivity or sensor failure problems, the smart farming system can not receive the soil moisture data given by the irrigation management. Deep learning techniques can predict soil moisture data using other irrigation management types as data from weather, crop, and irrigation systems. The Fog Computing paradigm also tackles the connectivity problem in the farms since it extends the traditional cloud computing architecture to the edge of the network, providing edge nodes with computational resources to process and analyze sensor requests. In this context, we propose different deep neural network architectures to build prediction models of soil moisture. We also handle the problem of missing data for the dataset features. For this purpose, we use KNN data imputation, which requires filling the values of unknown (or missing) features with values that ensure a desired degree of reliability. Finally, we also embedded the prediction models on a small single-board computer, often used as a fog node, to evaluate the performance of the prediction models according to CPU and RAM usage. This evaluation showed a maximum consumption increase of 10\\\\% CPU and 1\\\\% RAM. Therefore, the models are viable to fog architectures in the Internet of Things context. Our results indicate that the predictive models achieve a satisfactory efficiency to improve irrigation water saving.',\n",

The current research article presents an Artificial Intelligence Enabled Coconut Tree Disease Detection and Classification (AIE-CTDDC) model for smart agriculture. The aim of the presented AIE-CTDDC technique is to classify the coconut tree diseases in a smart farming environment so as to enhance the crop productivity. Firstly, the AIE-CTDDC model applies median filtering-based noise removal technique. Then, the Bayesian fuzzy clustering-based segmentation method is employed for the detection of the affected leaf regions. Besides, the capsule network (CapsNet) method is exploited as a feature extractor. In this study, the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model is exploited for the detection of diseases in coconut trees.

These days, Internet-of-Things (IoT) is the most fascinating topic that provides solutions to these limitations in various ways. The IoT is utilized in various healthcare conducts that include detection, treatment, and monitoring of diseases. Wearable devices are a part of IoT that is proposed for helping patients to get the correct treatment. The conventional communication networks developed for humans-based applications face many issues like stringent latency, restricted computing capability, and short battery life. On the other hand, the onset of 5G has developed a new set of technologies that offer the vital \"backbone” for connecting to the billions of devices for the upcoming IoT that would completely modify our professional and private lives. Due to the data capabilities, intelligent management, and superfast connectivity of 5G, this network has enabled new health care opportunities that include treatment, data analytics, diagnostics, and imaging. In the current review, a systematic literature survey of IoT, IoT-based wearable devices, and the role of 5G in IoT for healthcare is described in detail. Furthermore, we have explained the usage of wearable devices in detecting the issue in terms of healthcare, such as curing, monitoring, and detection of disease. Nevertheless, this review article also emphasizes the employment of IoT architecture and its wearable devices in addition to the upcoming research challenges related to this area.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Internet of Things (IoT), being a global infrastructure, aims to improve the quality of our lives. The potential applicability of IoT to almost every field of life, gives rise to an increased adoption of IoT solutions across the world. This increase in the number of IoT solutions leads to generation of large amount of data. Collecting, communicating and extracting useful information from this huge amount of data is a challenging task. Some effective methods are, therefore, required to handle and analyze IoT data, in order to extract some meaningful information. Dimension reduction is a method which retains only the meaningful features of the data and helps to have reduced data with only the necessary information. This study aims to identify the influence of dimension reduction on IoT data in terms of storage, and communication cost. it also analyses how dimensionality reduction of IoT data affects the performance of different classification algorithms applied to it. It has been found that dimension reduction helps to reduce the storage and communication costs of IoT data, while reducing the performance of classification algorithms applied to dimensionally reduced data. However, this reduction in performance is negligible as compared to storage and communication cost optimization.',\n",

Cheap sensors, climate data, soil information, and drones are now used to solve many real-time problems. One of the most emerging topics in the IoT in the Agriculture field is IoT based precision agriculture. The range of IoT applications can range between water spraying from drone, soil recommendation for different crops, weather prediction and recommendation for water supply, etc. In this paper we propose a system that will recommend whether water is needed or not by predicting the rain fall using Genetic Algorithm. In this article, we proposed a unique decision making method to predict Rainfall using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to identify the necessity of manual water supply is needed or not. The sensor based system will be activated to check wheather the GA based system completes its prediction correctly or not by sensing moisture level from the soil. If the moisture level of the soil crosses the pre-defined threshold value then plant watering is performed by quadrotor UAV. A terrace gardening system is also implemented in this article, which uses a pump for water spraying. Various atmospheric parameters help to develop a rainfall prediction system to enhance efficiancy more than 80\\\\% in the proposed IopaT system to make the system more interoperable.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background As same as the priority and importance of food for being alive for humans, its science play also a significant role in the world. So, food science, food technology, food industry, food processing, human nutrition, functional food, and nutraceuticals dominate daily life to have a healthy lifestyle. Before all of them, agriculture has provided primary necessities for food products. In the agricultural stage, the elimination of hazardous chemicals and micro-organisms is vital. In the next step, in food processing, several criteria should be checked to have a qualified food product, such as food quality and food safety. Furthermore, evaluating food intake supports nutrition-related aspects of diet. Scope and approach Nowadays, the implementation of cutting-edge technology, artificial intelligence (AI) especially machine learning (ML), with both advantages and disadvantages, in different academic and industrial fields is popular. Food science and technology and the related issues are no exception to this rule. Improving agriculture, facilitating crop classification, developing formulation, and new food and nutraceutical-related products, more accurate sensory evaluation, industrial processing, increasing food quality, ensuring food safety, managing the supply chain, reusing waste, and finally estimating calorie and nutrient amounts are some achievements of combination of food science and artificial intelligence (AI). Accurate sensory evaluation is particularly done utilizing electronic nose (E-nose), bio-electronic and electronic tongue (E-tongue), and machine vision. Key findings and conclusions Assaying artificial intelligence algorithms in agriculture, food science, and nutrition could lead to an intelligent from-farm-to-fork cycle also a significant improvement in this scientific breakthrough.',\n",

Due to increase in mission-critical infrastructures, we make use of these new technologies for reliable communication but their security is always not promising in terms of availability, confidentiality, integrity, and privacy of network services. Users can be compromised and vulnerable by a motivated malicious opponent unless they are not adequately protected by a robust defense. Due to this reason, an ambient intelligence approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required. In this research, ww proposed Ambient Approach based on Reinforcement Learning Integrated Deep Q-Neural Network (RL-DQN) model for WSNs and IoT in which it leverages the Markov decision process (MDP) formalism to enhance the decision performance in IDS. We deploy RL-DQN-IDS over Edge-cloud intrusion detection infrastructure in which binary attack classification of the network traffic is performed at the edge network while multi-attack classification is performed at the cloud network. To identify intrusions, we use a two-phase process that includes an initial learning phase that relies on RL, followed by a detection and classification phase that relies on DQN. We used four datasets namely UNSW-NB-15, BoTNeTIoT-L01, CICIDS2017 and IoTID20 with a smart house simulation environment configured with WSN and IoT technologies to evaluate performance. Accuracy, precision, and recall were all considered while assessing the dataset under consideration. When compared to five other machine learning models, the RL-DQN model method has demonstrated superior performance. This model outperforms the other five that were tested.',\n",

IoT problems deal with massive amounts of data with critical challenges such as complex and dynamic search spaces, multiple objectives and constraints, uncertainty, and noise that require an efficient optimizer to extract valuable insights. Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is an efficient optimizer stimulated by the hunting mechanism of wolves. The increasing trend of applying GWO shows that although it is a simple algorithm with few control parameters, it effectively solves optimization problems, particularly in various IoT applications. Therefore, this study reviews applying GWO, its variants, and its developments in IoT applications. This systematic review uses the PRISMA methodology, including three fundamental phases: identification, evaluation, and reporting. In the identification phase, the target search problems are defined based on suitable keywords and alternative synonyms, and then 693 documents from 2014 to the end of 2023 are retrieved. The evaluation phase applies three screening steps to assess papers and choose 50 eligible papers for full-text reading. Finally, the reporting phase thoroughly examines and synthesizes the 50 eligible articles to identify key themes related to GWOs in IoT applications. The eligible GWOs are reviewed in the development, commercial, consumer, and industrial categories. The paper visualized the spreading of eligible GWOs according to their publisher, application, journal, and country and then suggested future directions for research.',\n",

Ad-hoc routing protocols may be dispersed and involve every node in route discovery process by making routing data more reliable. Mobile-Adhoc-Networks (MANETs) consist of many portable nodes that can commune directly with each other or through intermediate nodes. Repeatedly, nodes in a MANETs operate with batteries and can roam freely, and thus, a node may exhaust its energy or move away without providing any notice to its cooperative nodes. IoT system using a combination of MANET, a route consists of numerous links in sequence, and so, its lifetime is based on the lifetime of every node and also the wireless links among adjacent nodes. In this research work Fuzzified Particle Swarm Optimization oriented Routing (FPSOR) algorithm is planned to minimize data loss and computational overhead, which in turn maximizes the lifetime of MANETs. Particle Swarm Optimization oriented Routing protocol (PSOR) have taken energy competence as significant criterion for processing routing and driving optimized path for the data accelerating and processing to the source node. The PSOR produces a fresh route for routing by considering fitness value of energy to evaluate diverse path and to choose best-optimized path whose energy consumption is less as compared to ant colony optimization routing paths. This algorithm utilizes a good approach focusing energy levels/status of the nodes through fuzzification and the lengths of the routed ways. NS2 simulator is casted for performance evaluation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The recent statistics on Agriculture identically remarks the massive contributions of mushroom farming in the Global market. Thus, the popularity of mushroom farming and cultivation is increasing day after day. Weather monitoring and management is a significant feature for mushroom growth, especially the impact of temperature and humidity. Most of the farmers in remote areas worldwide use traditional ways to cultivate the mushrooms. The traditional way is very complicated, and often poisonous mushrooms appear due to the lack of sufficient weather and cultivation process monitoring. This paper reflects an architectural design of IoT \\\\& Machine Learning (ML)-based Smart Mushroom Farming. The proposed system introduces Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM), Farm Automation, and Mushroom classification. The Internet of Things (IoT), the microcontroller ESP32, and some agriculture-related sensors enable smart monitoring and farm automation. Machine Learning (ML) technology has been adopted to classify edible mushrooms to avoid poisonous mushrooms. To investigate the efficiency of the proposed system, several experiments have been enumerated and interpreted. The study is further furnished with the System Usability Scale (SUS) to track the regular user's satisfaction and gained the SUS score of 82\\\\%. The ML model is utilized by an ensemble model that is composed of six classifiers namely Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF). The highest accuracy gained with the ensemble model is 100\\\\% which outperforms each individual classifier. However, the system will be efficient for real-time farm automation and cultivation in the mushroom industry.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hyperconnectivity, real-time processing, and interoperable communication facilities are key to the Next Generation (NG) Internet of Things (IoT). However, existing IoT architectures employ a diverse range of communication technologies to support desired data rates and coverage range, making them more complex to manage. The emerging IEEE 802.11ah standard, marketed as WiFi HaLow™, enables seamless communication among large-scale and energy-efficient sensor/actuator nodes to the Internet. IEEE 802.11ah introduces key features like Restricted Access Window (RAW) for reducing contention, Hierarchical Traffic Indication Map (TIM) and Association Identifier (AID) for efficient scheduling and device identification, and multiple Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCSs) for adaptive data transmission, enhancing IoT connectivity in Next-Generation IoT (NGI) communication. In this paper, we discuss IEEE 802.11ah for NGI concerning different requirements in terms of communication and computation. We survey the suitability of 802.11ah for NGI as compared to the existing state-of-the-art connectivity solutions. Thereafter, an IEEE 802.11ah-based NGI architecture and protocol stack are proposed and discussed, according to the different distinct features of this novel technology. Finally, we conclude by enumerating research and future directions for the proposed network architecture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'World agriculture faces the challenge of increasing its agricultural production by 50 \\\\% from 2012 to 2050, while reducing water consumption, as agriculture accounts for 69 \\\\% of all fresh water used on the planet. The use of technologies such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, digital twins, among others, in the agricultural environment is increasing. Digital twin applied to agriculture is in its early stages of development. A digital twin is one in which data flows automatically and in both directions between a physical object and a virtual object. Withing this context, this paper presents a digital twin of a smart irrigation system in an application scenario. A digital twin for an irrigation system is one in which the physical components of the system, such as its sensors and actuators, are connected with their virtual representations. The system is composed of a FIWARE-based internet of things platform and a discrete event simulation model in Siemens Plant Simulation software. The internet of things platform is used to collect, aggregate and process soil, weather and crop data to calculate daily irrigation prescriptions. The simulation model is used to simulate the behavior of an irrigation system defined in an application scenario. The communication between the platform and the simulation model happens in real-time and is intermediate by an OPC UA server. A application scenario is considered to evaluate the behavior of the system and to evaluate, in future research, different irrigation strategies. The benefits of the systems proposed are twofold. First, evaluate the behavior of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform and an irrigation system before implementing both in the field. Second, enable the evaluation of different irrigation strategies in parallel with current farm practices. Within the system proposed, farmers can evaluate the behavior of the system before implementing in their farms and allowing the system to operate automatically. It is possible to infer that the system can improve farm operations and reduce water usage by allowing farmers to gather soil, weather and crop information and evaluate multiple irrigation strategies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Internet's ever-increasing popularity may be attributed to its ubiquitous accessibility. At this point, IoT has reached its pinnacle, with a wide variety of devices and appliances effectively linked to sensors \\\\& Internet, ushering in a new age of convenience and connectivity. It is challenging to secure because of the diverse combination of sensors, the Internet, and objects. Using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, farmers may control their crops and agricultural fields remotely. Recent studies have concentrated on finding ways to improve precision agriculture's security infrastructure. Prior efforts to improve security services in the case of precision agriculture enabled by IoT have been minimal. By resolving issues related to cluster key management and overcoming obstacles associated with web interface configuration, the proposed work has established a novel approach that enables cluster key management to enhance security. Additionally, a web interface for gathering information from sensor nodes has been developed. After an IoT sensor detects a signal, the user may handle notifications using a web interface. When dealing with the vast infrastructure of IoT, it may be challenging to ensure the security of individual sensor nodes, particularly when only partial details about the hardware and the capacity for deployment are available. As a result, key management has emerged as a critical issue, especially in light of the node-capturing assault. Using the EBS function Object() [native code] and the Chinese remainder theorem, this research provides a new method of cluster key management that may improve agricultural accuracy. After collecting information from the nodes, the Backend Server sends a filtered list, together with preloaded keys and an authentication code, to the Cluster Head. This system incorporates a secondary layer of encryption for further protection. Our proposed method outperforms existing strategies in terms of delivery success rate, energy efficiency, and packet loss.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In smart farming, information and communication technologies such as IoT are driving the agricultural industry towards improved efficiency and productivity while reducing human intervention. As agricultural systems become increasingly connected to the Internet, they provide many new opportunities but also introduce new challenges. Connecting such systems to a network exposes them to cyberattacks and vulnerabilities; therefore, security and privacy are important challenges that should be addressed. Specifically, because of the distinct characteristics of smart farming such as environmental and farm conditions, security solutions suitable for smart farming are indispensable. In this paper, we propose a location verification (LV) protocol as a security solution for autonomous and intelligent moving devices such as drones and robots deployed in smart farming. Moreover, as an application of the proposed LV protocol, we propose a blockchain-based secure drone rental mechanism for smart farming. We present a security analysis in which the proposed LV protocol and rental mechanism are secure against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, modification, replay, and relay attacks, with the rental mechanism providing mutual authentication. Through a performance evaluation of the LV protocol in terms of the communication overhead, computation cost, and storage cost and a performance evaluation of the blockchain for drone rental with regard to throughput and latency, we confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the LV protocol and drone rental mechanism in the smart farming.',\n",

Innovative agricultural advancements has undoubtedly supported the expansion of the capacity and efficiency of different agricultural activities. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization assessment, the world’s population is expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and 9.6 billion by 2050 which will result in an unprecedented demand for food and agriculture products. It is estimated that the food production should increase by 70 percent to meet such a demand. Given the limited farming space, lack of water, climate change, and constantly changing environmental conditions, new and innovative smart agriculture solutions must be developed. In general, there has been an increase in the agricultural production volume over the time to ensure the food security. Efforts are being made to increase the quality and quantity of agribusiness products by transforming them into smart and connected products through a smart agriculture industry.

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) connects schemes, programs, data management, and operations, and as they continuously assist in the corporation, they may be a fresh entryway for cyber-attacks. Presently, illegal downloading and virus attacks pose significant threats to IoT security. These risks may acquire confidential material, causing reputational and financial harm. In this paper hybrid optimization mechanism and deep learning,a frame is used to detect the attack prevention in IoT. To develop a cybersecurity warning system in a huge data set, the cybersecurity warning systems index system is first constructed, then the index factors are picked and measured, and finally, the situation evaluation is done.Numerous bio-inspired techniques were used to enhance the productivity of an IDS by lowering the data dimensionality and deleting unnecessary and noisy input. The Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO) is a developed bio-inspired algorithm that improves the efficacy of the IDS in detecting both regular and abnormal congestion in the network. The smart initialization step integrates the different pre-processing strategies to make sure that informative features are incorporated in the early development stages, has been improved. Researchers pick multi-source material in a big data environment for the identification and verification of index components and present a parallel reduction approach based on the classification significance matrix to decrease data underlying data characteristics. For the simulation of this situation, grey wolf optimization and whale optimization were combined to detect the attack prevention and the deep learning approach was presented. Utilizing system software plagiarism, the TensorFlow deep neural network is intended to classify stolen software. To reduce the noise from the signal and to zoom the significance of each word in the perspective of open-source plagiarism, the tokenization and weighting feature approaches are utilized. Malware specimens have been collected from the Mailing database for testing purposes. The experimental findings show that the suggested technique for measuring cyber security hazards in IoT has superior classification results to existing methods. Hence to detect the attack prevention in IoT process Whale with Grey wolf optimization (WGWO) and deep convolution network is used.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Human-induced carbon emissions and the resulting increase in global warming are the major threats to the habitability of our world. Even though there are several reasons for carbon emission, the energy consumed by the residences also has a significant impact on this. The developments in technology create tools to fight global warming. Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become the primary of these tools. AI can learn, establish relationships, and make decisions for particular problems, and combining the capabilities of AI with the practical and efficient use of the IoT would accelerate the fight against carbon emissions. However, global implementation of these tools is increasingly crucial for the solution. In this study, a global model based on IoT and AI has been designed to control residences’ energy consumption. The model is trained using the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm, and unique data sequences are created for each unit of the model. The smallest units are directed with central intelligence by providing data minimization. The pre-simulation of the model shows that the model is capable of reducing and stabilizing annual carbon emissions at the targeted rate by intervening with the devices connected to the global model and providing 21\\\\% of the decrease in carbon emission. Therefore, improving, developing, and implementing the model in the medium term could be used as one of the primary practical tools to reduce carbon emissions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture plays a vital role in building the nation’s economy. To enhance the country’s financial standings, it is essential for farmers adopt innovative agricultural techniques/practices. Over the years, a rapid growth has been experienced within this domain by virtue of adapting agricultural sensors, drones, Global Positing Systems (GPS), and other integrated devices. However, adaptation of newer practices is completely overlooked by most farmers across the state of Punjab in the Indian sub-continent. It has been visualized that farmers across the state are hesitant to adapt precision agricultural practices. This is mainly due to several constraints that are encountered by the farmers across the state, i.e., non-awareness of the concept among farmers, financial limitations, and other associated factors within the domain. Hence, to clearly understand the mindset of the farmers and their perception towards the adaption of precision agriculture techniques, the authors have prepared a structured questionnaire that consisted of 30 questions. The questionnaire was prepared to capture farmers’ basic tendency towards various hurdles that farmers encounter while adopting precision agricultural practices. Responses of 342 farmers across the state of Punjab was taken under consideration to further evaluate the mindset of farmers on the following key points, i.e., Various parameters such as basic knowledge on the usability of agricultural sensors, expectation level of farmers towards adaptation of agricultural sensors, and support from the state government, issues related to cost of agricultural sensors, and issues related practical implementation of agricultural sensors. To evaluate the responses, One-way ANOVA and Independent-sample T-test were analyzed over Statistical Packages for Social Science (SPSS) Version 22. In addition, descriptive analysis (on individual responses) has been presented within the results section and coefficient of correlation (r) has also been has also been calculated to identify the degree of relationship among dependent and independent variables. f-distribution results obtained over SPSS software depicted a positive inclination among farmers towards usage and adaptation of newer farming concepts, provided some constraints needed to be addressed with a pragmatic approach. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the reasons for the shortcomings for non-adaptability of modern day agricultural practices among farmers and to bridge a gap among farmers and state/central government on motivating and providing all sorts of possible assistance in adopting precision agricultural practices with an aim to make effective use of land and enhancing production scale.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aim of this study is to improve ride comfort among tractor drivers by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze and predict vibration exposure. The study explores the association between tractor ride characteristics, including average speed, tool depth, and pulling force, and ride comfort during actual rotary soil tillage operations. Ride comfort was evaluated by calculating the Overall Vibration Value (OVV) at three measurement locations (i.e., the floor, seat pan, and seat backrest). The study employed spectral analysis i.e., Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) to determine the predominant resonant frequencies. In addition, ML approaches i.e., Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used to predict ride comfort response. Three hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian optimization were used. Tractor-tiller system was operated on a real agricultural field by five male tractor drivers. Vibration levels were measured along three translational axes at three measurement locations using a smart monitoring device based on the IoT concept. Average OVV magnitude was computed as 0.84 m/s2 i.e., exceeding the ISO 2631-1 (1997) threshold limits. FFT and PSD analysis revealed a variety of dominant frequencies, including resonance peaks at 2 Hz, 6–7 Hz, and 9–11 Hz. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that tractor speed and tool depth are significant variables (at the 5\\\\% level) in determining ride comfort. Regarding predictive accuracy, the ANN model exhibits the highest coefficient of determination of 0.90, followed by the SVM and GPR models with a coefficient of determination of 0.89. The DTR and LR models demonstrate slightly lower coefficient of determination values of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization proved to be an effective approach in achieving more accurate predictions of tractor ride comfort. In general, the study outcomes can be utilized by tractor designers in numerous ways to optimize tractor design (such as suspension system, cab design, seat design, etc.) to improve tractor ride comfort in real field applications.',\n",

How do these new technologies enter our communities, and when they do, how do they complement or disrupt existing activity? This paper provides a framework for addressing these questions, building on a case study of the automated pizza vending machine that is proliferating in France. Relying on an exclusive and newly constructed database, we examine the diffusion of smart pizza vending machines across over 30,000 French communities. Contrary to our expectations, we find that neither the large, dense, and most connected urban centers nor the rural areas with limited access to food options are the first adopters of these machines. Instead, small but well-connected communities, with attractive consumer bases but which lack 24/7 amenities, are at the vanguard of the adoption of this \"frugal\" IoT innovation – i.e., one that requires little capital investment but potentially meets widespread demand. Furthermore, we find that independent business owners and small entrepreneurs are the early adopters of the new technology, but they act as forerunners for larger corporate actors. Based on these findings, our proposed framework highlights the decentralized and bottom-up processes that give rise to the rapid penetration of frugal IoT technologies and their associated socio-economic effects.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision agriculture improves field-level management practices for promoting sustainable food production systems. Moreover, sustainability in farm production requires matching the farming practices more closely to the potential of soil fertility, crop needs, and environmental conditions. Whereas precision agriculture aims at enhancing farm profits by (1) efficient resources management through variable-rate application of nutrients, agrochemicals, and water, (2) reducing crop yield losses during harvesting, (3) minimizing environmental risks (i.e., reduced greenhouse gas emissions and nutrients leaching), and (4) optimizing footprints of the farming inputs (e.g., carbon sequestration and soil organic matter). Keeping in view the potential of precision agriculture technologies in terms of increasing farm profits while protecting the environment is in fact based on the site-specific application of agricultural inputs. Therefore, writing a book on precision agriculture technologies will pave the way for creating its awareness among the farmers and policymakers as well as will also serve as a guideline for its successful adoption. As part of the book, this chapter deals with the concepts of climate change, food security, modern agricultural tools, techniques, technologies, farm profitability, and environmental stewardship for precision agriculture to canvas the technical, sustainable, socioeconomic, and environmental aspects of precision agriculture technologies. In this chapter, data collection tools, analysis techniques, computer modeling, and model selection, methods of crop yield monitoring and prediction through proximal sensing, application of agrochemicals using variable-rate technologies, and machine learning algorithms are presented for benefit of the farmers and stakeholders.

       "  'abstract': 'Solar radiation measurements are highly important for achieving energy efficiency in smart buildings as well as solar energy production. They are commonly acquired with pyranometer sensor device. However, due to its high initial and maintenance costs it is not densely deployed in the field. Consequently, it provides only limited coverage as a data source for solar radiation. Hence, theoretical, empirical and/or data-driven models are utilized to estimate solar radiation in areas without pyranometers using only data from meteorological sensor stations, which on the other hand are widely available and obtained from sustainable sensor networks. In this paper, end to end process is described for building hybrid models for solar radiation using Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more specifically Machine Learning (ML) methods, after which a detailed analysis is performed on (1) the accuracy of the models regards to their parameters and input features, (2) the sustainability of the models in the real world, and finally (3) their feasibility in (near) real-time monitoring. The results are expressed with relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) and they show that hybrid models outperform model- and data-driven ones, with artificial neural network giving the best results (RRMSE = 0.0393). Additionally, the models can be enhanced by performing an informed feature selection, where a posteriori selection proves to be better than a priori selection (RRMSE = 0.0371). Further investigation shows that randomly selected input data gives faster model convergence as expected. However, sequential input data can match it if model training starts with autumn or spring data when weather exhibits sufficient variety. When applied on different times scales, all models perform best on 3h scale rather than daily, where random forest (RRMSE = 0.0275) outperforms neural network (RRMSE = 0.0315). However, for (near) real time usage the models perform almost the same as for daily, with RRMSE of 0.0469 for 1min scale with neural network. This demonstrates the feasibility of the hybrid models in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which commonly require at least hourly intervals for solar radiation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In this study, we propose the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data for crop recommendation (CR). CR is critical in agriculture, assisting farmers in making informed decisions about crop cultivation, considering factors like soil conditions, weather patterns etc. Unfortunately, the availability of labeled data for CR is often limited, posing a significant challenge in training accurate recommendation models. VAEs and GANs are employed to create synthetic data that closely mirrors real-world crop data. VAEs are utilized to extract latent representation from the input data, enabling the generation of new samples with similar characteristics. GANs play a crucial role in generating data by training a generator network to produce synthetic samples that closely resemble real data, while a discriminator network distinguishes between genuine and synthetic data. The generated synthetic data serves as a valuable resource to prepare datasets for CR, enhancing the performance of recommendation models. Our research explores the effectiveness of VAEs and GANs in producing high-quality synthetic CR data, facilitating improved training and evaluation of recommendation systems. This paper presents the architecture and training process of the proposed models and evaluates the quality and utility of the generated synthetic data using various experiments, including visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, cumulative sum per feature plots, and distribution per feature plots. The results of this study hold the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of agriculture by providing a reliable and abundant source of training data for CR systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Tourism and the hotel business have benefited greatly from the use of digital social networking. Using social big data research, the application of deep learning seems to have been beneficial in a marketing strategies and customer preference estimate. Recognizing human psychology, which is critical to industrial success, has benefited greatly from digital technology and social media. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a chance for a hotel sector to improve the customer experience although lowering operational expenses. The ratings are determined by the following factors: Value, Apartment, Location, Hygiene, Front Office, Facilities, Professional Service, Internet, and Parking. Traditional techniques which anticipate hotel evaluations through minimal precision add difficulty to the rating assessment. As a result, efficient deep learning algorithms are employed to evaluate reviews designed to help consumers in selecting better hotels. To predict qualities, multiple classification techniques, including convolutional neural network-based deep learning (CNN-DL) and support vector machine (SVM) network-based deep learning, were used in this research. The system examines system efficiency by using the TripAdvisor website, this is a well American database. The research results reveal that the CNN-DL method outperforms another method in terms of classification efficiency and failure rate.The graphical results could also be utilized to enhance the effectiveness of the suggested model and offer insights into response tactics, demonstrating the study's academic and conceptual achievements. Although it is feasible to conclude from such research that the possibility of IoT within the hotel industry has not yet been fully investigated, as researchers commonly speculate on using IoT for implementations that might quickly be of involvement to a hotel sector, but refuse to recognize that possibility as a massive market.\",\n",

This article exhaustively examines the removals and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the agriculture industry. It also investigates an extensive range of GHG sources, including rice cultivation, enteric fermentation in livestock, and synthetic fertilisers and manure management. This research reveals the complex array of obstacles that are faced in the pursuit of reducing emissions and also investigates novel approaches to tackling them. This encompasses the implementation of monitoring systems powered by artificial intelligence, which have the capacity to fundamentally transform initiatives aimed at reducing emissions. Carbon capture technologies, another area investigated in this study, exhibit potential in further reducing GHGs. Sophisticated technologies, such as precision agriculture and the integration of renewable energy sources, can concurrently mitigate emissions and augment agricultural output. Conservation agriculture and agroforestry, among other sustainable agricultural practices, have the potential to facilitate emission reduction and enhance environmental stewardship. The paper emphasises the significance of financial incentives and policy frameworks that are conducive to the adoption of sustainable technologies and practices.

       "  'abstract': 'Precision farming aims to optimizing the crop production process and managing sustainable supply chain practices as more efficient and reasonable as possible. Recently, various advanced technologies, such as deep-learning and internet of things (IoT), have achieved remarkable intelligence progress in realistic agricultural conditions. However, crops species recognition can be considered as fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) problem, suffering the low inter-class discrepancy and high intra-class variances from the subordinate categories, which is more challenging than common basic-level category classification depended on traditional deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper presents a fine-grained visual recognition model named as MCF-Net to classifying different crop species in practical farmland scenes. Proposed MCF-Net is consisted of cross stage partial network (CSPNet) as backbone module, three parallel sub-networks, and cross-level fusion module. With multi-stream hybrid architecture utilizing massive fine-granulometric information, MCF-Net obtains preferable representation ability for distinguishing interclass discrepancy and tolerating intra-class variances. In addition, the end-to-end implementation of MCF-Net is optimized by cross-level fusion strategy to accurately identify different crop categories. Several experiments on in-field CropDeepv2 datasets demonstrate that our method favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. The recognition accuracy and F1-score of MCF-Net achieves very competitive results up to 90.6\\\\% and 0.962 separately, both of which outperforming contrasted models indicate better recognition accuracy and model stability of our method. Moreover, the overall parameters of MCF-Net are only 807 MByte with achieving a good balance between model’s performance and complexity. It is acceptable and suitable to the implementation of IoT platforms in precision agricultural practices.',\n",

Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability.',\n",

In spite of their light-weight design and low power, their vulnerabilities often give rise to cyber risks that harm their operations over network systems. One of the key challenges of securing IoT networks is tracing sources of cyber-attack events, along with obfuscating and encrypting network traffic. This study proposes a new network forensics framework , called a Particle Deep Framework (PDF), which describes the digital investigation phases for identifying and tracing attack behaviors in IoT networks. The proposed framework includes three new functions: (1) extracting network data flows and verifying their integrity to deal with encrypted networks; (2) utilizing a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to automatically adapt parameters of deep learning; and (3) developing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on the PSO algorithm to discover and trace abnormal events from IoT network of smart homes. The proposed PDF is evaluated using the Bot-IoT and UNSW\\\\_NB15 datasets and compared with various deep learning techniques. Experimental results reveal a high performance of the proposed framework for discovering and tracing cyber-attack events compared with the other techniques.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision agriculture, driven by advancements in sensing technologies and data analytics, offers promising solutions for addressing challenges in paddy disease management. Paddy diseases have significant detrimental effects on crop yield and quality, necessitating timely and accurate detection for effective disease management. Deep learning has shown promise in identifying plant diseases from leaf images, including those in paddy crops. However, the presence of slight variations among different types of paddy diseases poses a significant generalizability challenge. In this study, for the first time, we introduce a lesion-aware visual transformer for accurate and reliable detection of paddy leaf diseases through identifying discriminatory lesion features. A Novel multi-scale contextual feature extraction network is presented to enable capturing a contextual local and global representation of disease features at different scales and channels. Then, a weakly supervised Paddy Lesion Localization (PLL) unit was presented to locate distinctive lesions in paddy leaves that provide the model with discriminative leaf regions that can guide the final classification decision. A feature tuning unit is presented to empower modeling the relations within the global and local latent spaces, thereby improving the spatial exchanges between visual semantics of paddy leaves. The exhaustive experimental comparison against state-of-the-art solutions on public paddy disease datasets demonstrated the efficiency and versatility of our system with an average of 98.74\\\\% accuracy and 98.18\\\\% f1-score.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the decades, agri-food security has become one of the most critical concerns in the world. Sustainable agri-food production technologies have been reliable in mitigating poverty caused by high demands for food. Recently, the applications of agri-food system technologies have been meaningfully changing the worldwide scene due to both external strengths and internal forces. Digital agriculture (DA) is a pioneering technology helping to meet the growing global demand for sustainable food production. Integrating different sub-branches of DA technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics into agriculture practices to reduce waste, optimize farming inputs and enhance crop production. This can help shift from tedious operations to continuously automated processes, resulting in increasing agricultural production by enabling the traceability of products and processes. The application of DA provides agri-food producers with accurate and real-time observations regarding different features influencing their productivity, such as plant health, soil quality, weather conditions, and pest and disease pressure. Analyzing the results achieved by DA can help agricultural producers and scholars make better decisions to increase yields, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and manage resources. The core focus of the current work is to clarify the benefits of some sub-branches of DA in increasing agricultural production efficiency, discuss the challenges of practical DA in the field, and highlight the future perspectives of DA. This review paper can open new directions to speed up the DA application on the farm and link traditional agriculture with modern farming technologies.',\n",

To increase the credibility scores in trust management, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has been adopted. However, the current need for digital acceleration has brought ethical concerns related to the smartness and social consciousness of autonomous objects, which leads to a question whether AI-based trust management is ready to deal with these concerns. In this paper, we consider 11 ethical dimensions within the context of trust management in SIoT. Then, we examine the existing AI-based trust models in the context of SIoT and its related application domains to assess their maturity in terms of the 11 ethical dimensions.

       "  'abstract': 'Aquaculture involves cultivating various marine and freshwater aquatic creatures within regulated environments. Monitoring the aquatic environmental conditions in real-time is crucial for successful fish farming. The Internet of Things (IoT) offers significant potential for real-time monitoring, and this paper introduces an IoT framework designed for efficient monitoring and effective control of various water-related aquatic environmental parameters. The proposed system is implemented as an embedded system utilizing sensors and an Arduino microcontroller. In cultivating pond water, diverse sensors such as pH, temperature, and turbidity sensors are deployed, with each sensor connected to an Arduino Uno-based microcontroller board. These sensors collect data from the water, which is then stored as a CSV file in an IoT cloud platform called ThingSpeak through the Arduino microcontroller. To gather data for analysis, we conducted measurements across five ponds, varying in size and environmental conditions. After getting the real-time data, we compared our experimental results with the standard reference values. As a result, we could take the decision of whether a pond is suitable for cultivating fish or not. After that, we labeled the data with 11 fish categories: Katla, sing, prawn, shrimp, rui, tilapia, pangas, karpio, magur, silver carp, and koi. The data was analyzed using 10 machine learning (ML) algorithms, including J48, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), K*, Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree), Jumping Rule Inference with Pruned Search (JRIP), Partial Decision Trees (PART), Decision Table, and Logit boost. After experimental analyses, it was discovered that only three of the five ponds were ideal for fish farming, and those three ponds only met the required standards for pH, Temperature, Turbidity, and Conductivity. Among the state-of-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest achieved the highest score of performance metrics as accuracy 94.42\\\\%, kappa statistics 93.5\\\\%, and Avg. TP Rate 94.4\\\\%. In addition, we calculated the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for one scenario.

Smart Farms’ unprotection may cause significant economic losses and low yields of production. This paper introduces an optimization model for providing reliability and, consequently, service continuity to the IoT-Fog-Cloud continuum-based smart farms. The proposed model allows Smart Farming stakeholders to find the optimal number of Fog Nodes needed to deploy farming services considering the heterogeneity in the fog capabilities, resource demands, redundancy techniques, and reliability requirements. The model was solved using linear programming and evaluated with different demands and protection schemes. Results show that protection schemes guarantee high reliability and reveal that a shared redundancy scheme reduces deployment cost and yet provides reliability. Results also indicate that deployment costs and resources depend on the type of fog-based smart farm services to serve. Moreover, they show that deploying more low-resource hardware can be less expensive for low-reliability demands than deploying with a few high-resource hardware.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Driven by the need to ensure the connectivity of an unprecedentedly huge number of IoT devices with no human intervention the issues of massive connectivity have recently become one of the main research areas in IoT studies. Conventional wireless communication technologies are designed for Human-to-Human (H2H) communication which leads to major problems in primary access, channel utilization and spectrum efficiency when massive numbers of devices require connectivity. Current random access procedures are based on a four-step handshaking with control messages which contradicts the requirements of IoT applications in terms of small data payloads and low complexity. Targeted channel utilization and spectrum efficiency cannot be achieved using traditional orthogonal approaches. Thus the goal of our work is to review the most recent developments and critically evaluate the existing work related to the evolution of network access methods in the new communication era. The paper covers three major aspects: first the primary random access procedures, proposed for IoT communications are discussed. The second aspect focuses on the approaches for integration of existing random multiple access schemes with non-orthogonal multiple access methods (NOMA). This integration of random access procedures with NOMA opens a new research trend in the field of massive connectivity. Operating on space domains additional to the physical domain such as code and power domains, NOMA integration targets increased channel utilization and spectrum efficiency to complement the flexibility of random access. On the other hand, the design of efficient algorithms for massive connectivity in IoT is also challenged by the highly application and environmentally dependent traffic model. A new angle of tackling this problem has emerged thanks to the extensive developments in machine learning and the possibilities of their incorporation in communication networks. Thus, the final aspect this review paper addresses are the newly emerging research directions of incorporating machine learning (ML) methods for providing efficient IoT connectivity. Breakthrough ML techniques allow wireless networking devices to perform transmissions by learning and building knowledge about the communication and networking environment. A critical evaluation of the large body of work accumulated in this area in the most recent years and outlining of some major open research issues concludes the paper.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Digital Twins are very promising to bring smart farming to new levels of farming productivity and sustainability. A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent of a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Using Digital Twins as a central means for farm management enables the decoupling of physical flows from its planning and control. As a consequence, farmers can manage operations remotely based on (near) real-time digital information instead of having to rely on direct observation and manual tasks on-site. This allows them to act immediately in case of (expected) deviations and to simulate effects of interventions based on real-life data. This paper analyses how Digital Twins can advance smart farming. It defines the concept, develops a typology of different types of Digital Twins, and proposes a conceptual framework for designing and implementing Digital Twins. The framework comprises a control model based on a general systems approach and an implementation model for Digital Twin systems based on the Internet of Things—Architecture (IoT-A), a reference architecture for IoT systems. The framework is applied to and validated in five smart farming use cases of the European IoF2020 project, focussing on arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming and livestock farming.',\n",

Unlike conventional networks, Internet of things have unique attributes such as heterogeneity of devices, high scalability and diverse architectures that makes its malware analysis complex. In this paper, we propose an approach for analyzing and classifying IoT malware using Haralick image texture features and machine learning classifiers namely K-nearest neighbor(KNN), naïve Bayes (NB) and random forest(RF). A binary file (malicious or benign) is converted to a gray scale image. The gray level co-occurence matrix (GLCM) is computed on each of the extracted image. On the basis of these GLCM parameters, five Haralick features namely angular second moment, entropy, contrast, inverse different moment and correlation are calculated. Finally, these Haralick texture features are used to perform malware classification using random forest, naïve Bayes and K-nearest neighbor. Experimental results shows that our approach obtains 95\\\\% accuracy for Random Forest, 89\\\\% for naïve Bayes and 80\\\\% for K-nearest neighbor classifiers. Overall, use of texture feature can realize a low computational and platform independent classification scheme for IoT malware.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Due to the world's rapid population expansion, the demand for food is anticipated to increase significantly during the coming decade. Traditional farming practices cannot meet the need for the food crop. Conventional farming methods use resources like land, water, herbicides, and fertilisers rather inefficiently.

How people and machines operate on farms has been changed by integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with numerous sensors, controllers, and communication protocols. A comprehensive literature review of the key technologies involved in smart and sustainable agriculture, viz. various sensors, controllers, communication standards, IoT based intelligent machinery, were compared and presented. These sensors were continuously producing a significant quantity of data on the agricultural field. These data were transmitted to the central control unit for analysis to meet the demands for water, fertiliser, pesticides, etc. The architecture and importance of data analytics in agriculture IoT, case studies of current agricultural automation utilising IoT, key challenges and open issues in agriculture IoT technology were discussed. The findings provide support for the selection of IoT technologies for specific applications.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision Agriculture (PA) promises to meet the future demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel while keeping their production sustainable and environmentally friendly. PA relies heavily on sensing technologies to inform site-specific decision supports for planting, irrigation, fertilization, spraying, and harvesting. Traditional point-based sensors enjoy small data sizes but are limited in their capacity to measure plant and canopy parameters. On the other hand, imaging sensors can be powerful in measuring a wide range of these parameters, especially when coupled with Artificial Intelligence. The challenge, however, is the lack of computing, electric power, and connectivity infrastructure in agricultural fields, preventing the full utilization of imaging sensors. This paper reported AICropCAM, a field-deployable imaging framework that integrated edge image processing, Internet of Things (IoT), and LoRaWAN for low-power, long-range communication. The core component of AICropCAM is a stack of four Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) models running sequentially: CropClassiNet for crop type classification, CanopySegNet for canopy cover quantification, PlantCountNet for plant and weed counting, and InsectNet for insect identification. These DCNN models were trained and tested with {\\\\textgreater}43,000 field crop images collected offline. AICropCAM was embodied on a distributed wireless sensor network with its sensor node consisting of an RGB camera for image acquisition, a Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer for edge image processing, and an Arduino MKR1310 for LoRa communication and power management. Our testing showed that the time to run the DCNN models ranged from 0.20 s for InsectNet to 20.20 s for CanopySegNet, and power consumption ranged from 3.68 W for InsectNet to 5.83 W for CanopySegNet. The classification model CropClassiNet reported 94.5 \\\\% accuracy, and the segmentation model CanopySegNet reported 92.83 \\\\% accuracy. The two object detection models PlantCountNet and InsectNet reported mean average precision of 0.69 and 0.02 for the test images. Predictions from the DCNN models were transmitted to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for visualization and analytics. We concluded that AICropCAM successfully implemented image processing on the edge, drastically reduced the amount of data being transmitted, and could satisfy the real-time need for decision-making in PA. AICropCAM can be deployed on moving platforms such as center pivots or drones to increase its spatial coverage and resolution to support crop monitoring and field operations.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Potato, one of the five most important products grown in the world, has a high application potential in terms of smart agriculture. Smart agriculture makes it possible to produce potato crops in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way for future generations. Smart farming practices are involved in almost all growing and even marketing processes to increase crop production and quality. Thanks to smart agricultural practices, it has become possible to increase the agricultural productivity of potatoes, to follow the development of certain parameters and to make appropriate decisions. As smart farming develops over the next few years, it will replace traditional farming methods and help narrow the gap between large and small farmers. With the technological progress, it has become possible to control the field situation and make decisions about the crop in real-time environment. Smart-farming may be applied to all processes of potato value-chain production including seeding, irrigation, soil monitoring and nutrients intelligence, harvesting, pest-disease-weed detection, quality, quantity, harvesting, and climate monitoring, forecasting and decision-making applications. These applications are capable to monitor, and define where, when, and how much variability is existent in a field and even take decision autonomously to manage it. In this chapter smart farming concept was emphasized and its difference from precision agriculture was explained. Examples of smart agriculture applications that take place in almost all cultivation and even marketing processes to increase potato production are given under Smart Farming Applications topic. In the last part of the chapter the potential of smart farming technologies for potato production was explored. The covered topics include technologies such Decision Support Systems, IoT (Internet of Things) and Sensors, Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geospatial Information System (GIS), Artificial Intelligence.',\n",

Technological innovation simplifies the process of determining the optimal answer to societal challenges. Throughout, it requires a delicate balance of economic and technological improvements. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies and the integration of these technologies into various aspects of our lives are inevitable. One of the most significant changes that AI will bring is the fourth industrial revolution or what is known as Society 5.0. Society 5.0 achieves balance between these fundamental characteristics through the use of data-driven AI. The primary difficulty with AI is the uncertainty inherent in the methodologies and algorithms governing its processes and actions. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is gaining traction in the mainstream by elucidating the processes and outcomes of a complicated system. It teaches the model to generate the expected outcome using the appropriate strategy. Machine learning (ML) techniques are critical insights in XAI because they enable the replication of complicated real-time systems that demand predictions. Contemporary societal applications are in desperate need of AI technology and machine learning techniques to forecast disease and treatment methods based on existing data. This chapter discusses the ramifications of XAI for Society 5.0, as well as the function of ML and deep learning (DL) algorithms. It also discuss the field of XAI and its applications in society 5.0 as a human relationship-oriented concept, while at the same time achieving societal benefits by improving human decision-making.',\n",

At the same time, increasing security attacks on these networks raised alarms for timely response by forensic investigators to avoid severe consequences of the attacks. Major network forensic approaches proposed so far for IoT are based on recording and analyzing the network traffic to produce suitable evidences. One of the greatest challenges in this process is the identification and correlation of suitable artifacts among volumes of network packets to reconstruct the attack scenarios during forensic investigation. To address this challenge, we propose ProvNet-IoT, a novel provenance based forensic model for investigating network level attacks in IoT environment. The interactions between different nodes at network layer are depicted using information, functional, and event modeling techniques. We use progressive network provenance to explain different events pertaining to various attack scenarios and to provide forensically sound evidences. ProvNet-IoT is validated using two publicly available labeled IoT datasets with a corpus of different attacks. Experimental results showed the benchmark performance of ProvNet-IoT in identifying selective artifacts to produce reliable evidences during forensic investigation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Double ring infiltrometer is a simple device used to measure water infiltration rate in the soil, one of the most important hydro physical characteristics and an essential parameter for various applications including: surface irrigation and drainage projects, infiltration or water purification basins, seepage losses at canals, soil leaching at waste storage sites. However, the high spatial variability of a soil makes a single point measurement rarely representative of an entire field. Nonetheless, Double Ring Infiltration tests are tedious, time consuming and require continuous attention, hence limiting the number of tests that may be performed simultaneously on a given site. In the present research, an automated Internet of Things (IoT) double ring infiltrometer (DRI) is developed and validated in a loamy field. It consists of a DRI equipped with an ESP-32 microcontroller chip, a GPS module, a solenoid valve, a DIY conductance water level sensor, and a SD card module powered by a 12 V 11000mAh Li-ion battery charged by a 10 W solar panel. The double ring infiltrometer is designed to calculate the infiltration rate in real time, to store the data with the time stamp and geographical coordinates on an SD card or, to use a cloud service platform to upload the data over the internet. The aim is to facilitate soil infiltration mapping for precision agriculture and to build a soil infiltration inventory that could be used to continuously improve existing soil database. The system was assembled and tested at nine different locations on a loamy soil experimental field. For validation, conventional (manually operated) tests were conducted at the same time. The system proved to be reliable (R2 = 0.99), cost effective (115\\\\$) and a hassle-free solution, ideal for multiple soil infiltration measurements.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aquaculture produces nearly half of the seafood consumed by the ever-growing world population. There have been attempts to adopt novel technologies into the industry to increase profitability, particularly the Internet of Things (IoT). In aquaculture, it is therefore important to evaluate and address the challenges related to IoT. The purpose of this review is to categorize the challenges associated with implementing IoT systems in aquaculture according to the literature. This work reviewed prototyped IoT systems reported in the literature in the last five years. Moreover, some potential solutions to the reported challenges were discussed with the help of literature that can be used by researchers in the future. Among IoT systems used in aquaculture, some challenges are common, while others are specific to particular species or farms. Due to direct contact with water, maintenance of sensor probes is a common challenge. The literature addressed this problem through different designs that led to self-cleaning mechanisms. There were three categories of specific challenges: infrastructure-related, data-related, and perception-related. Infrastructural challenges primarily relate to electricity availability and internet connectivity. For electricity, energy harvesting technologies are suggested, and for internet connectivity, satellite internet or offline systems are suggested. The data related category covers challenges related to data loss due to device or network errors. Studies have shown that incorporating soft methods can help resolve most of these issues. Perception-related challenges examine barriers that prevent aquaculture farmers from implementing IoT systems. As one potential remedy for this barrier, literature suggests policy makers intervene in promoting the benefits of IoT systems and providing incentives.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart Irrigation System is a complex concept used to control, monitor and automate the irrigation of yields by integrating artificial intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning strategies. SIS has endorsed various machine learning models. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way. Moreover, ML based SIS often face problems and raise questions that must be resolved. This article presents a systematic literature review of ML based SIS; an overview of the literature on ML is designed, revealing a premier and unbiased survey of the existing empirical research. 55 selected studies published from 2017 to 2023 and nine broadly used ML models were identified. Furthermore, four analysis aspects namely type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context have been outlined. The findings of this review prove the performance capability of the ML techniques endorsed within SIS. The ML techniques outperform other conventional approaches. However, the application of ML models in SIS is still limited and more effort is needed to obtain well-formed and generalizable results. To this end, and based on the outcomes obtained in this work, future guidelines have been provided to practitioners and researchers to grasp the major contributions and challenges in the state-of-the-art research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Internet of Things (IoT) is the collection of physical and digital devices that are interconnected using Internet for exchange of information and delivery of services. The Internet of Things (IoT) is an extended application of Internet that is used to offer various services for users in the fields of agriculture, healthcare, education, smart homes and so on in the modern world. The significant issues of the intrusion present in IoT are network disconnection, network hacking and data theft from the source. So the challenging task for worldwide utilization of IoT is to address their security issues, because of the feature imbalance in the different types of attacks. The most essential task for addressing security issues is to predict and classify the intrusion in the network. In this paper, the Cost based Random Forest Classifier (CRFC) is proposed for developing an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The CRFC based classification is improvised by incorporating the cost matrix calculated based on feature importance that helps to improve the process of splitting the features even if there is a feature imbalance. Further, three important libraries of Python namely, Spark, Kafka, and Scikit-learn are used in this IDS to improve the classification performances. In that, Spark is used to implement the distributed environment, Kafka is used for streaming the data and Scikit is used to implement CRFC. There are two datasets known as NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 that are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed CRFC-IDS method. The CRFC-IDS method is analyzed on the basis of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Measure, Area Under the Curve (AUC), False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The existing approaches OCSVM and DBF are used for comparison with the CRFC-IDS method. The accuracy of CRFC-IDS for NSL-KDD dataset is found to be 99.957\\\\%, which is highest when compared to OCSVM and DBF.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been growing over the past few years due to its flexibility and ease of use in real-time applications. The IoT's foremost task is ensuring that there is proper communication among different types of applications and devices, and that the application layer protocols fulfill this necessity. However, as the number of applications grows, it is necessary to modify or enhance the application layer protocols according to specific IoT applications, allowing specific issues to be addressed, such as dynamic adaption to network conditions and interoperability. Recently, several IoT application layer protocols have been enhanced and modified according to application requirements. However, no existing survey articles focus on these protocols. In this article, we survey traditional and recent advances in IoT application layer protocols, as well as relevant real-time applications and their adapted application layer protocols for improving performance. As changing the nature of protocols for each application is unrealistic, machine learning offers means of making protocols intelligent and is able to adapt dynamically. In this context, we focus on providing open challenges to drive IoT application layer protocols in such a direction.\",\n",

This study conducted a systematic literature mapping of the mechanisms for measuring Internet of Things technology maturity in enterprises and organizations. A systematic search was executed in six databases, which yielded 1181 studies. Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 78 primary studies were selected for analysis to address the research questions and perform a bibliometric analysis. The primary outcome of this research revolves around the existence of multiple mechanisms used to measure the technological maturity of the Internet of Things, including maturity models and frameworks. However, there currently needs to be standardized methods to accomplish this task. The P2668/D5 standard can serve as a reference for criteria, scales, and dimensions. Another significant result refers to the evolving nature of this field, with Germany, India, and China emerging as the main contributors to its progress. Finally, the main challenges and associated problems revolve around the absence of standardization, limited accessibility, and lack of specificity of measurement tools.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture industry faces the challenge of increasing productivity by 50\\\\% from 2012 to 2050 while reducing water usage, given that it currently consumes 69\\\\% of the world’s freshwater. To achieve this goal, smart technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twins (DT), and Internet of Things (IoT) are being increasingly utilized. However, the use of DT in agriculture is still in its early stages. This study proposes a smart irrigation framework inspired by digital twins in an application domain. The irrigation framework’s sensors and actuators are linked to their virtual counterparts to create a digital twin. The IoT platform collects, aggregates, and processes data to determine daily irrigation requirements, and the behavior of the irrigation system is simulated. The proposed framework has two main advantages: evaluating the behavior of the digital twin and IoT platform in the context of agriculture before integrating them into the field and comparing various irrigation methods with current farming methods. By providing farmers with information about soil, weather, and crops, the system has the potential to improve farm operations and reduce water consumption.',\n",

Therefore, this research aims to assess the risks of implementing IoT in RES based on the hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach under uncertain conditions in Iran. In this study, to specify the importance of criteria, the Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (F-SWARA) method is utilized, and to assess the risks of IoT integration in RES, the usage of the Fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (F-CoCoSo) method is suggested. The following examines the sensitivity analysis and validation with fuzzy WASPAS, fuzzy ARAS, and fuzzy TOPSIS techniques.

In this work, we present an IoT-based sound detection model for identifying red palm weevil (RPW) larvae to protect date palm trees at the early stage of infestation. The proposed detection system is mainly based on a modified mixed depthwise convolutional network (MixConvNet) as a recent deep learning classifier. The public TreeVibes dataset, which contains short audio recordings of feeding and/or moving RPWs, was successfully tested and assessed with the proposed MixConvNet classifier. There were 146 and 351 specimens of infested and clean sounds examined, respectively. The classification results showed that our proposed MixConvNet is efficient and superior to other deep learning classifiers, such as Xception and residual network (Resnet) models in previous related studies, obtaining the best accuracy score of 97.38. Moreover, the MixConvNet classifier is capable of identifying RPW infestation cases precisely with a high accuracy value of 95.90\\\\% ± 1.46, using 10-fold cross-validation. Therefore, practical implementation of our proposed IoT-enabled early sound detection system of RPWs is considered the future milestone of this study.',\n",

For these technologies to become popular, they must have a high level of reliability and safety.

Some unprecedented shocks are encumbering food security at the global level. Various interventions have been applied toward food security and artificial intelligence is one of the modern methods that is being used in various stages of the food system. In this paper, the application of artificial intelligence in the whole food production ecosystem ranging from crop production, livestock production, harvesting/slaughtering, postharvest management, food processing, food distribution, food consumption and food waste management is assessed. The objective of this research is to assess the application of artificial intelligence systems in all the stages of food systems. A systematic review was conducted by analyzing 110 articles after the screening of 450 articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results indicated that various artificial intelligence algorithms are being applied to all the stages of the food system from crop/livestock production up to food or agro-waste management.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The agriculture sector, worldwide, faces grand challenges that significantly threaten food security and environmental sustainability. Smart farming technologies (SFTs) have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these challenges and achieve the balance between productivity increment and environment safety, yet their adoption rate remains relatively low and fragmented. Extant literature, consequently, has extensively investigated and discussed the factors that affect the adoption of SFTs. Although some prior reviews have attempted to assemble previous discourse concerning the adoption of SFTs, they fell short in offering a comprehensive, structural, and focal overview. Hence, this paper reviews the literature around the adoption of SFTs with a specific focus on software and/or hardware technologies that are usually utilized to manage in-field agricultural activities. Using a framework-based systematic review, the paper synthesizes findings from 182 empirical studies to provide an in-depth and retrospective overview of the main theories, characteristics, contexts, and methods. The paper also demonstrates a state-of-the-art integrative framework of the main drivers of and barriers to the adoption of SFTs. Finally, the paper suggests future pathways for prospective scholars to advance our knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon of SFTs adoption.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart Health Care offers efficient, sustainable, along with real-time human services, and the concept of enhanced Internet of Things (IoT) lies behind the emergence of this smart Health Care (HC). Nevertheless, the association of these IoT-centric sensors with other organizations generates security threats that an illegal user might utilize it owing to the data’s openness. In the HC sector, data security and privacy are the prime concern in which the alteration in data values as sensors could modify the diagnosis process, which may cause serious health problems. The immutability and transparency of the blockchain make it a viable option for the safe storage and management of healthcare data. However, the Cloud Storage Server (CSS), consensus latency, majority attacks, Byzantine problem, uncomfortable data Throughput (TP), et cetera, make the blockchain vulnerable to healthcare data transmission. To solve the current disadvantages, a secure IoT was introduced in healthcare using Brooks Iyengar Quantum Byzantine Agreement-centered Blockchain Networking (BIQBA-BCN). This study ensures the sincerity and equity of health data exchange. Based on Blum Blum Shub and Okamoto Uchiyana Cryptosystem (OUCS) mutual authentica1tion, the proposed work provides an OUCS-based mutual authentication system (BBS-OUC). Attackers are prevented from entering the BCN, ensuring the storage remains trustworthy. In addition, the Key Weight Block Function-Quasi-Cyclic Moderate Density Parity Check (KWBF-QCMDPC) algorithm safeguards the confidentiality and dependability of IoT user data. The cryptosystem technique protects sensitive data when the blockchain platform is distributed. The proposed methodology, known as BIQBA-BCN, results in a security level that is \\\\%94 effective. Finally, the BIQBA-BC consensus mechanism is used to distribute data to the corresponding Hospital Server (HS). By achieving a higher data TP, lower delay, higher Success Rate (SR), shorter consensus latency, and node communication time, the experimental results show that the proposed methodology is exceptionally safe against assaults and highly scalable.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Agricultural product prices are subject to significant fluctuations due to variations in sales cycles, impacting people's quality of life and farmers' income while potentially giving rise to social problems. To address this issue in the smart agriculture supply chain, advancements in technologies like big data and artificial intelligence have made it feasible to predict agricultural product demand and price trends. Among the research methods, deep learning, being highly reliant on data and possessing multi-layered implicit information, has emerged as the most popular research method, exhibiting better data representation and prediction capabilities. In this study, we propose an end-to-end agricultural product price prediction model that combines complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) with long short-term memory (LSTM). The prediction generated by this model will provide guidance throughout various supply chain links, including production, harvesting, storage, and logistics. Moreover, the study aims to develop auction mechanisms based on the prediction results to achieve an optimal allocation of agricultural products. To address issues of low computational efficiency and limited benefit distribution in the auction process, this study introduces a deep learning-based iterative bilateral auction algorithm (DL-IDA), which improves upon existing methodologies by leveraging the power of deep learning. Empirical analysis is conducted using the daily price of Fuji apples at the Beijing Xinfadi market. The results demonstrate that the CEEMD-LSTM model proposed in this study exhibits superior performance in predicting agricultural product prices. Furthermore, experimental findings validate the effectiveness and superiority of DL-IDA. Compared to existing iterative bilateral auction algorithms, DL-IDA offers better performance in terms of running time, social welfare, buyer benefits, seller benefits, and broker benefits. Consequently, it can contribute to a transparent pricing mechanism for agricultural products.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Predictive Maintenance (PdM) of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to enhance their reliability is becoming increasingly crucial as the IoT develops. Loss caused by malfunction can be avoided or minimized if appropriate preparations are made in advance. By summarizing the relevant literature, the use of deep learning to establish the PdM model has become a current research hotspot, but few studies use the classification method. In the multivariate time-series data produced by IoT devices, each data has a temporal and spatial correlation, so how to obtain the two correlations should be given more attention. We propose to extract temporal correlation using the Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) because it can identify long-term dependencies. To obtain spatial correlation, we propose a one-dimensional dilated group convolution with residual connection (1DDGCR) block. The residual connection in it can avoid gradients vanishing as the network deepens. Then we propose a novel PdM model for IoT equipment combining LSTM and 1DDGCR. It is named LSTM\\\\_1DDGCR. We utilize the FD001 public dataset, which is a subset of the C-MAPSS dataset, to evaluate the performance of LSTM\\\\_1DDGCR. We compare it with two models proposed by previous researchers and find that the proposed LSTM\\\\_1DDGCR model shows better performance. In addition, LSTM\\\\_1DDGCR is applied to a real-world dataset, and it also shows good performance in practical applications.',\n",

Moreover, the rapid infestation of pests and insects may face a serious problem in agricultural yield. In existing works, the images are collected from the IoT sensors for pest detection and classification, but it is not satisfactory to acquire higher results regarding accuracy. To solve this issue, a novel pest detection and classification model is suggested. The major intention of the developed method is to detect and identify pests over crops using an object detection model and enhanced classifier. Initially, the IoT platform is included, where the required data is garnered through agriculture-based IoT sensors. The input images are garnered and fed into the subsequent object detection process. Pest detection is obtained through an optimized Yolov3 model. Here, the hidden neurons are optimized by the Adaptive Energy-based Harris Hawks Optimization (AE-HHO) algorithm. The detected pest images are given to the feature extraction process. The deep feature extraction is utilized with the help of Residual Network50 (ResNet50) and Visual Geometry Group16 (VGG16) models. Then, the classification is performed by Weight Optimized Deep Neural Network (WO-DNN) model. Consequently, the WO-DNN of the weight factor is optimized using the AE-HHO algorithm. Finally, the classified outcome is predicted by the AE-HHO algorithm. Hence, the performance is validated with several measures and compared with existing detection methods. Throughout the analysis, the accuracy and F1-score of the designed method attained 96\\\\% and 84\\\\%. Thus, the results explore that the suggested method proves better efficiency in pest detection and classification.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the recent years, the growth of technology and the resulting transformation is happening at a rapid pace. In this junction, IoT has provided a great platform and bridge between these technologies. A lot of research regarding the application of IoT Systems has been done in the recent years but one area that lacks research is security issues in Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT).It is noticed that security and Privacy in NB-IoT system is a challenging task for researchers and academia. Application of NB-IoT in Defense security opened a new way for the researchers but at the same time security threat can lead to drastic loss. Nowadays, MEMS-NB-IoT device (Bug)/ BOT are being used for carrying out any malicious security attack. This can be a serious area of concern in the case of defense security. These MEMS device are very dangerous and it can spoof data from any type of network. The size of this device is very small, it can travel to any location for monitoring the enemy movement, and it is very difficult to identify these types of bugs. These BOT device very sensitive at Perception and Network Layered. In this paper, we have provided detail analysis of IoT/NB-IoT Layered architecture. A novel proposal depicting security attack in a Smart home system with IoT and NB-IoT enabled devices is presented. The Secrecy Rate (SR), the Secrecy Outage Probability (SOP) is being calculated, and performance analysis of IoT system in the presence of Bugs for a smart home system is carried out. Simulations have been performed and the performance analysis done is based on Security non-outage probability vs security rate with real time analysis.',\n",

It is used to store encrypted data; on the other hand, in artificial intelligence, human natural intelligence can be simulated. All the characteristics of the human brain may be programmed with artificial intelligence. Blockchain technology may be thought of as a body and artificial intelligence as its brain. In blockchain technology, if artificial intelligence approaches are used, then data collection, data enabling, data analytic, and decision-making of data collection can be improved. With both these technologies, we will be able to affect and enact upon data in different ways. Also, they may be proven as game-changers in the exploitation of data. At the same time, machine learning approaches may enhance the architecture of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology can make artificial intelligence further rational and comprehensible. We can trace the trail of decisions and determine why a particular decision was taken by a machine learning algorithm and on the other hand, blockchain technology records data and variables that go through in the decision-making process in machine learning. In this chapter, we have discussed key concepts of blockchain technology and applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the blockchain.

       "  'abstract': \"Nowadays, with an increasing expansion of the internet of things (IoT) that has created massive data streams, online attack detection via stream processing has become a matter of extensive attention. Current encryption and authentication methods cannot satisfy the security requirements of IoT critical infrastructures because of many heterogeneous connected devices, a wide network geographical scope, rapid software development, the possibility of security bugs, and the emergence of new attacks. Therefore, an extended method based on machine learning, which can process data stream to detect the fog layer's IoT attacks and prevent the spread of intrusion to other network segments, was proposed in this paper. The IFogLearn++ uses a fog layer to facilitate fast data stream processing in the fog layer. Using a fog layer helps the network tolerate more attacks due to the annexation of an extra security layer before the cloud layer. Based on the results, the IFogLearn++ has similar accuracy to competitors and 18 and 8 times faster performance compared to SVM and Learn++. This characteristic helps secure massive data streams in IoT.\",\n",

In this paper, we describe the initial stages of developing, a new Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning (ML) to detect routing attacks against RPL. We first simulate the routing attacks and capture the traffic for different topologies. We then process the traffic and generate large 2-class and multi-class datasets. We select a set of significant features for each attack, and we use this set to train different classifiers to make the IDS. The experiments with 5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that decision tree (DT), random forests (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) achieved good results of more than 99\\\\% value for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and RF has achieved the lowest fitting time.

Nutrient smart city circular economy is currently an understudied intersection of growing city populations of food consumers, nutrient recovery technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), and agriculture. Meanwhile, machine learning has exploded with popularity over the years, with many circular economy literatures examining its usefulness in its predictive qualities to support management, optimisation, and recovery of useful resources from organic waste. This review paper examines advancements in machine learning for macronutrient recovery in city organic waste systems for a circular economy. The use of ML will greatly improve the scalability, transparency, productivity and accuracy of nutrient: recovery technologies, logistics, dissemination, and reuse. ML can also be combined with hardware to automate tedious waste separation, recovery and agricultural tasks using drones, hydroponics and satellites. Meanwhile, crop yields, nutrient demand-supply efficiencies, food security, environmental soil monitoring, and prosumer involvement could all increase. However, ML applications for urine, anaerobic digestion and prosumer economics are lacking.',\n",

In India, agricultural practices were introduced in 9000BCE that led to the early cultivation of plants as well as the domestication of crops and animals. Between the 18th and 19th century, the agricultural practices in India spread widely, promoting the different farming techniques. After independence, our country has made great progress in food productivity and food security as well as a substantial increase in the availability of food grains. The government of India also promoted innovative technologies and policies in the agricultural sector. Therefore, different high-yield crops were promoted to increase nutritious food production and boost local economies. Through agriculture, rural areas have been developed by implementing new technologies and smart tools. In rural areas, there are several issues in agriculture, transport, water, connectivity, health, and education. To solve these issues, the government promoted lots of technologies and policies by the help of which the development of rural areas can be boosted up. In this chapter, we will discuss the contribution of the Internet of Things (IoT) in poverty reduction, increasing the local economy, enhancing farming techniques, and promoting the sustainable development of rural areas. IoT controls crop management, waste management, irrigation systems, energy management, and other field works easily. IoT supports poverty alleviation and increasing the living standards of people in rural areas. This discussion provides a vast study on IoT in agriculture for sustainable rural development.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Along with the arrival of the 5G era, sustainable and renewable energy supplies have become urgent demands towards plentifully distributed devices utilized for constructing smart cities. On the one hand, although the low-entropy fossil energies are constantly transformed into high-entropy energies and consumed through various batteries, the large-scale combustion inevitably brings a huge carbon footprint and severe climate changes. On the other hand, mechanical energies are widely distributed in the urban environment in types of vibrations and rotations, and natural areas in types of water waves, rainfalls, and winds. With the development of mechanical energy harvesting technologies like triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, etc., various mechanical energy harvesters with optimized structures and selected materials, including triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), electromagnetic generator (EMG), etc., have been demonstrated for efficiently extracting electric power from ubiquitous existed mechanical energy sources like wind, water waves/flows, raindrops, vibrations, human motions, organs, and so on. With a comprehensive review of energy harvesting-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) applications among smart environmental monitoring (wind, ocean, and agriculture), smart transportations (drivers, vehicles, ships, roads, and bridges), smart homes (windows, floors, accessories, and human-machine interfaces), smart healthcare (wearable/portable devices, and implantable devices), the concept of smart cities are being promoted to conform with requirements of carbon neutrality and environment-friendly. Moreover, by combining developed self-powered sensor nodes, self-sustainable wireless sensor nodes, and self-charging energy storage units, the concept of IoT will be reinforced by increasing 5G endpoints and accelerates digitalization in smart cities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"It is increasingly acknowledged that e-governance is crucial for implementing government services. The ultimate goal of e-governance is to enable the government to deliver services to its citizens and decision-makers efficiently and cost-effectively. E-Government services have the potential to benefit both governments and citizens by increasing access to services while decreasing the cost of providing them. Over a period of time, there has been a significant advancement in technology. Governments are facing many challenges in rendering e-Government services to their citizens. To ensure that the benefits reach the last person in society, the government must promote e-Government services. Therefore, governments must apprehend the main barriers to achieving comprehensive government transformation while developing and delivering e-government services using artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the benefits. For this, a reference model is required which is independent of technical platforms and organizational structure, which comprehends the framework and guidelines to deploy e-government services, analyze the services, and ease use for the citizens. The Internet is the backbone of any e-Governance services. Worldwide, efforts are being made to make e-Government services available to their citizens to reduce costs and provide efficient and effective systems. E-Governance offers new means of communication between the government and its citizens. If not correctly integrated, E-Government services may lead to various threats and will tend to fail. The breach in data privacy and security are some of the threats associated with it. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can provide more sophisticated solutions to these threats by detecting anomalies and securing the data to prevent threats. The Internet of things (IoT) can offer an unprecedented improvement and can significantly help in walks of our lives, and so is with the e-Government services. It can help in the surveillance and monitoring of the areas' critical security and safety, controlling traffic management, environmental pollution, fire detection, e-Health, e-Agriculture, e-Bill payment, etc. The proposed paper will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven Internet of Things (IoT) techniques to analyze and enhance e-government services to all stakeholders. Also, such AI techniques will support mitigating the associated risk of cyber-attacks. Factors affecting the adoption of e-government services, design, development, and implementation initiatives based on the proposed reference framework will undoubtedly benefit all stakeholders.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Generally, Home Health Care (HHC) consists of a medical team that serves patients in their own homes and carries out various medical services, such as taking biological samples and administering medicine. Aging trends in developing countries, and the growing tendency of the elderly to receive healthcare services in their own homes, leads to increasing demand for such services that outgrow those available in hospitals, healthcare personnel, and other resources. Therefore, HHC services and their associate demand rates are increasing dramatically. A major opportunity normally ignored in this regard is the applicability of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems to facilitate this practice. In this work, a two-phased approach is proposed to 1) identify the potential patients and 2) collect their biological samples and send them to be analyzed. Green Split Pick-up Vehicle Routing Problem (GSPVRP) and IoT concept are employed to address the patients in both sub-models. The proposed model is investigated by data from a real-world case study in Montreal, Canada, and solved using four multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms. An extensive analysis of the results revealed that utilizing the IoT system contributes to maximizing the overall occupancy rate of the vehicles and can effectively optimize the number of trips, hence minimizing total costs and greenhouse gas emissions.',\n",

The Social IoT has benefits of connectivity exhibited within the network of connected objects through the Internet of Things (IoT). It covers the entire world and provides innovative services to improve life standards, establishes novel businesses, and makes buildings and cities. Certain smart things allow the collection of ubiquitous data or traffic, which pose a threat to source location privacy. Therefore, it limits the source of the Internet of Things vision if implemented wrongly. These threats come along with some challenges, adversary profiles, and the location privacy of personal data. When they are used to monitor important assets, the attacker can easily hunt the location of these assets. However, the source location constitutes a way to prevent the adversary from finding the location of the source. This research has used a hybrid phantom method by combining the phantom node and multi-path route that improves privacy and reduces the consumption of energy. The Analytic Hierarchal Process (AHP) is used for phantom node selection, based on parameters such as energy, distance, heterogeneity, and neighbor list. The result shows the average consistency value of the parameters is 4.2 and the consistency index value is 0.066. The overall priority of the alternative node is 2.089 as compared to other nodes. The sum of the vector weight value is obtained as 4.845. The total average energy consumption is 1.211 J and the average safety period capture ratio is 59.41\\\\%. The proposed techniques overwhelmed the deficiencies in existing techniques, reduces energy consumption improves the safety period and increases the network lifetime.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'During the Disease outbreak and in the future, there will be a lot of learning. Since the pandemic has interrupted global schooling, remote learning has emerged as a viable option, depending on machine learning to accomplish its goals. Using the example of ten international science journals that speak out about artificial intelligence in education today and the future of earning, we hope to gain a better understanding of the large extend of the power of artificial intelligence in education, both during the COVID-19 period and during the future learning time frame. Additionally, in addition to evaluating 10 articles, we used an internet search engine to look for relevant material. We conducted searches using terms such as artificial intelligence, learning during a pandemic, and Machine learning, among other things. After that, we used a phenomenological technique to confirm that our results answered the research questions, which was done in accordance with a qualitative approach. Our findings can be summarized by taking into account the evidence from research and literature. Among our findings are that the detailed assessment of artificial intelligence in education, the use of AI in education, typical learning in the pandemic era, and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) disease outbreak learning are all important for both current and future residents. While statistical methods and automated based on learning jobs that are smarter than normal continue to be important, learning is becoming more automated. It helps individuals to be more concentrated on their learning opportunities and to recognize when they do not grasp a subject completely. First and foremost, the instructors provide valuable assistance throughout the assessment process of student learning outcomes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The infestation of litchi stink bugs (Tessaratoma papillosa) has always had a significant impact on the yield of longan plantations. Pest control is critical for farmers to detect and timely suppress the occurrence of pests while effectively reducing damages. Environmental factors, climate change in particular, have contributed to the growing population of pests whereas weather can vary in different terrains, locations, and time. Due to the geographical and topographical conditions of Taiwan, this study focuses on investigating fruit plantations on sloping land in subtropics with distinct seasonal changes. The article aims at forecasting meteorological data based on Long short-term memory network (LSTM) and identifying the correlation between pest infestation and environmental factors through Machine Learning (ML). In this section, the structure and experimental process of the research will be outlined. At the first stage, meteorological information of the experimented site is obtained through the self-designed IoT (Internet of Things) system and wireless long-distance transmission technology. Since meteorological information forecasted is displayed in time series, multi-layer LSTM and bidirectional LSTM are used to solve the problem. Finally, environmental data and field surveys conducted for pest surveillance will be employed to forecast the severity of pest infestation through KNN, SVM, and random forest models. The result of the experiment shows that LSTM performs well in weather forecasting with 96\\\\% R-Squared values whereas the accuracy rate of pest prediction conducted by Machine Learning (ML) is 85\\\\%. The study verifies that meteorological factors do affect pest incidence. For example, the population of litchi stink bugs increase easily under suitable temperature, humidity, and sunlight. LSTM is superior in providing solutions for long-range dependence in statistics. This article shall present regions with shifting weather patterns, meteorological conditions and time length forecasted corresponding to the oceanic climate, as well as the correlation between pest population and environmental factors.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) has been trending in the past few years, posing so many security problems. IoT Botnets are one of the most serious attacks that threaten the reliability of IoT systems because of IoT devices resources constraints. Most of the classical and even the intelligent solutions such as ML and DL for botnet detection are trained on unlabeled dataset, in other cases, dataset trustability is not approved but it is used, which may cause degradation of performance in case those models were implemented in security tools in order to deal with zero-day threats. Another two critical problems are the limits of classical oversampling methods while generating samples and the limits of understanding complex datasets and modeling real tabular data by the existing GAN models. The aim of this paper is to implement the CTGAN model, the state-of-the-art of Generative Adversarial Networks models in tabular data modeling and generation in order to overcome all previous mentioned limits. The results are promising. After data augmentation using CTGAN, MLP achieves an accuracy of 98.93\\\\%, F1-Score equal to 0.9907, Geometric-Score equal to 0.9874, sensitivity and specificity achieve resp. values of 0.9893 and 0.9856.',\n",

This paper presents the Ownership Transfer Protocol (OTP), which leverages Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) and blockchain technology to ensure the secure transfer of ownership for smart objects in the IoT. The proposed protocol can securely track and trace smart objects during their movement in the IoT supply chain. Unlike the traditional Ownership Transfer (OT) architecture, the proposed architecture does not require a Trusted Third Party (TTP) and can support Partial Ownership Transfer (POT). The innovative use of immutable blockchain architecture enabled the proposed protocol to effectively support distributed environments and authenticate both the device and involved parties. The proposed protocol is evaluated for its robustness against common attacks outlined in this paper and implemented using the Ethereum blockchain. The testbed results on Ethereum confirm the optimal gas consumption of the proposed model. Furthermore, utilizing the security claim verification tool, Scyther, the experiment validates the security claim regarding the communication between the parties involved in the proposed protocol’s OT process.',\n",

However, disease diagnosis is a difficult task owing to managing an enormous volume of data. Thus, in this research task, the latest IoT-assisted disease detection model for healthcare applications is developed. Initially, the patient data are taken from the IoT sensor devices in image, text, and signal data. The gathered patient data is further forward to the pre-processing phase. Accordingly, the images are gathered from patients’ data using IoT devices and forward to the feature extraction process. Feature extraction is done based on the IoT-collected images using VGG16 and Inception network. Moreover, the signals are garnered from the patient’s data and fed to the decomposition procedure. It is done by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique. Then, the optimal feature selection of data, images, and signals is carried out by a hybrid algorithm termed Mating Probability-based Hybrid Strider Glowworm Swarm Optimization (MP-HSGSO). Finally, the Radial Basis Recurrent Neural Network (RBRNN) using MP-HSGSO is suggested to get the detected outcomes. Here, various brain diseases have been detected to classify the disease. This designed RBRNN method is utilized for efficient treatment, and also it provides the appropriate decision-making through processing various kinds of multimodal data. Throughout the simulation outcomes, the accuracy and precision of the offered method achieve 97 \\\\% and 96 \\\\%. Consequently, the simulation outcome of the offered method is proved that the designed model using a deep learning model shows enriched performance in clinical trial applications.',\n",

In IoT systems, massive volumes of data must be processed, transformed, and analyzed on a frequent basis to enable various IoT services and functionalities.

However, applying ML models to IoT data analytics tasks still faces many difficulties and challenges, specifically, effective model selection, design/tuning, and updating, which have brought massive demand for experienced data scientists. Additionally, the dynamic nature of IoT data may introduce concept drift issues, causing model performance degradation. To reduce human efforts, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has become a popular field that aims to automatically select, construct, tune, and update machine learning models to achieve the best performance on specified tasks. In this paper, we conduct a review of existing methods in the model selection, tuning, and updating procedures in the area of AutoML in order to identify and summarize the optimal solutions for every step of applying ML algorithms to IoT data analytics. To justify our findings and help industrial users and researchers better implement AutoML approaches, a case study of applying AutoML to IoT anomaly detection problems is conducted in this work.

       "  'abstract': 'Groundwater resources in Nebraska, U.S. are closely monitored by 23 Natural Resources Districts (NRDs) located across the state. Growers who use groundwater for irrigation are required to have flow meters installed at wells to monitor their water usage. However, many of these flow meters are still being read and recorded through in-person visits, which can be time-consuming and costly. Although some flow meters in Nebraska are monitored remotely by telemetry-enabled camera systems, yearly telemetry costs are high and making long-term operation financially burdensome. Using less expensive network protocol, such as Internet of Things (IoT), to transmit flow meter readings could enable new monitoring opportunities. However, there are challenges in directly transmitting flow meter images via IoT due to limited bandwidth. Therefore, in this study, we developed an algorithm using object detection deep learning techniques, i.e. You Only Look Once (YOLO) that can be programmed at an IoT node which can recognize readings from images of flow meters onsite before transmitting. The developed algorithm could significantly reduce data size and is essential for flow meter monitoring in an IoT network setting. The developed algorithm achieved 95.35\\\\% accuracy when recognizing 1,248 real-world flow meter images obtained at the courtesy of North Platte Natural Resources District (NPNRD) in western Nebraska. The framework and algorithm were also tested in a real-world scenario on a flow meter installed on a linear-move sprinkler irrigation system and showed promising results. By leveraging IoT and deep learning techniques, this research has the potential to revolutionize flow meter monitoring, reducing costs and improving efficiency in the management of groundwater resources in Nebraska, and potentially in other regions as well.',\n",

Overapplication of agrochemicals on various components of the environment such as surface water, groundwater, and air has forced the researchers and farmers to adapt precise agriculture technologies to ensure that along with environment, crop yields are also not being negatively affected. The combination of advancements in precision agriculture technologies development with application of artificial intelligence algorithms in agriculture decision making will help scientists and farmers to develop and implement decision support systems for early warning applications for weather and disease/pests attacks. This could lead to reducing the negative impacts of agriculture industry on environment through enforcing and adopting mitigative strategies to minimize effects of climate change on crop production. Finally, how future climate changes could impact agricultural practices and what are the roles of precision agriculture technologies in mitigating the environmental pollution risks are discussed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we live and work by connecting everyday devices to the Internet. As the demand for IoT devices grows, a reliable and efficient communication infrastructure to support these devices has become crucial. Cellular IoT (CIoT) has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, offering a low-cost, low-power, and scalable communication network for IoT devices. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of CIoT technology in response to the growing demand for IoT applications with low latency, high coverage, low power consumption, high device connection, and low cost. The four major CIoT technologies standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) organization are investigated, including extended coverage global system for mobile communications IoT (EC-GSM-IoT), long-term evolution for machine-type communications (LTE-M), narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), and recently, new radio reduced capability (NR-RedCap). These technologies are analyzed regarding their fundamental focuses, features, use cases, requirements, and future work. In addition, we provide a comparative study of these types of IoT technology to assist researchers in understanding the available options and their potential limitations. Finally, open challenges are discussed to direct future research in the field.',\n",

These models include the diff model based on machine learning, cosine similarity model, Jaccard model, TF-IDF model, as well as the SimCSE and SBERT models based on deep learning methods. To fully leverage the characteristics of these models, three scenarios are designed to calculate the similarity scores based on experience and multiple experimental results. The results show that calculating the similarity scores using these three scenarios not only achieves high accuracy but also requires fewer computational resources. As deep learning and natural language processing technologies continue to advance, Text similarity detection methods based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing will continue to be improved and play a more significant role in practice.

       "  'abstract': 'Within the automotive industry, there are efforts to replace glass fiber composites to a greener yet lightweighted natural fibres as they could be reducing the environmental impacts. To know if these replacements are environmentally friendlier and how much they reduce the emissions within the life cycle of the vehicle, the gold standard is a life cycle assessment (LCA) based greenhouse gas emissions. LCA is a valuable tool, However, this method is time consuming, we have to address too many details, and it could get really complicated to perform. Artificial intelligence seems to be a very promising discipline that can easily predict a complicated inquiry. In this article, we have used machine learning to compare and predict the greenhouse emissions of replacing these materials in automotive parts. This work is unique in that it processes very limited input data, in contrast to the usual machine learning dataset. This limited data usually deter researchers from solving these kinds of problems, however, it enables us to test several artificial intelligence algorithms and input matrices to quickly predict the greenhouse gas emissions for our LCA based greenhouse gas emission saving predictions. Even though this method is not conventional and needed further discussions and testing, it is showing a very promising and easy way to predict the accurate greenhouse gas saving of these materials quickly and prior to the design of the auto parts.',\n",

However, in developing economies the adoption is in the nascent stage. This paper aims to evaluate the critical factors that impact the adoption decision of IoT technology in the Agricultural and Food Supply Chain (AFSC). Based on a comprehensive literature survey and experts’ opinion 24 critical factors were identified. The identified list of factors was categorized into technological, social, economic, and organizational categories. DEMA℡ method was applied to determine the cause-effect relationship of these factors. The results underlined five significant causal factors namely lack of interoperability, environmental sustainability, trust, lack of security, and network challenges which influence the IoT adoption. The results provide unique insights in agro-food sector to improve performance by overcoming the identified key challenges. Also, this study provides a roadmap for the implementation of IoT in emerging economies. Further, this paper guides the agri-food managers, IoT service providers, and the Government to formulate new strategies/policies for the effective adoption of IoT in the agri-food sector',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The increasing number of vehicles on the road has made traffic regulations challenging to manage, particularly in large and crowded cities. Real-time traffic monitoring systems are one of the most important factors that enable efficient traffic flow and enhanced mobility. Therefore, vehicles and drivers have always needed reliable and accurate real-time traffic information. Recently, various solutions have been proposed to solve the problems and concerns in traffic situations. One alternative solution is vehicular cloud computing (VCC). Additionally, an IoT-aided robotic (IoRT) model has been developed with a modern architecture that integrates IoT sensor nodes and cameras to gather real-time traffic data. The main contributions of this research work are to implement two deep learning techniques based on modified LeNet-5 for real-time traffic sign recognition and the transfer learning-based Inception-V3 model for detecting and recognizing traffic lights. Furthermore, optimal distance was found between the ultrasonic sensors and the obstacles using ultrasonics’ waves time and speed to reduce road accidents. The data, which is collected by sensors and cameras, is processed using various image processing algorithms and it is sent to the cloud to be available for drivers and commuters through a mobile application. Test results indicate that the proposed models have significant improvements in terms of accuracy. The modified LeNet-5 achieved accuracy rates of 99.12\\\\% and 99.78\\\\% on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and extended GTSRB (EGTSRB) datasets, respectively, whereas the second model, trained on Laboratory for the Intelligent and Safe Automobiles (LISA) dataset, attained a 98.6\\\\% accuracy rate. Compared to the related traffic monitoring systems, the findings of this study outperform other works by 3.78\\\\% for traffic sign recognition and by 1.02\\\\% for traffic light detection and recognition.',\n",

Many parts of a plant can be infected by a virus, fungal, bacteria, and other infectious organisms but here we mainly considered the detection of leaf disease of a plant as a research topic. We have performed an in-depth study of this topic from 2010 to 2022 and found that many researchers use multispectral or hyperspectral imaging to study crop diseases. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are used to classify different types of leaf diseases. We made a workflow mechanism to help researchers in this field. Support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest, and multiple twin SVM (MTSVM) are popular ML models for predicting leaf disease, while convolutional neural networks (CNN), visual geometry group (VGG), ResNet (RNet), GoogLeNet, deep CNN (DCNN), back propagation neural networks (BPNN), DenseNet (DNet), LeafNet (LN), and LeNet are common deep learning models used for detecting leaf disease. Among these deep learning models, it is evident that models like CNN, VGG, and ResNet are highly capable at finding diseases in leaves. The performance of the algorithms is generally evaluated using F1 score, precision, accuracy and others. This review will be helpful for the researchers who are working in this area and looking for various efficient ML and DL-based classifiers for leaf disease detection.',\n",

IIoT enables wide-scope data collection and utilisation, and reduces errors, increases efficiency, and provides an improved understanding of the process in return. While this novel solution is the pillar of Industry 4.0, the inherent operational complexity of bioprocessing arising from the involvement of living systems or their components in manufacturing renders the sector a challenging one for the implementation of IIoT. A large segment of the industry comprises the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals and advanced therapies, some of the most valuable biotechnological products available, which undergo tight regulatory evaluations and scrutinization from product conceptualisation to patient delivery. Extensive process understanding is what biopharmaceutical industry strives for, however, the complexity of transition into a new mode of operation, potential misalignment of priorities, the need for substantial investments to facilitate transition, the limitations imposed by the downtime required for transition and the essentiality of regulatory support, render it challenging for the industry to adopt IIoT solutions to integrate with biomanufacturing operations. There is currently a need for universal solutions that would streamline the implementation of IIoT and overcome the widespread reluctance observed in the sector, which will recommend accessible implementation strategies, effective employee training and offer valuable insights in return to advance any processing and manufacturing operation within their respective regulatory frameworks.',\n",

Several initiatives have been adopted to manage disease on crops which include new cultivation practices, genetic engineering, plant breeding and chemical control which have only proven to perform better on laboratory-based approaches.

With the advancement of technologies in Internet of Things (IoT) and different artificial intelligence models, non-visual signs of disease are being explored and experimented in this work for nonvisual early disease detection purposes. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Ultrasound, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium (NPK) fertilizer are profiled on control maize and inoculated maize with Exserohilum turcicum fungus to generate time series data. Dataset generated are preprocessed, analyzed, and visualized using pandas and matplotlib python tools. Machine Learning algorithms have been inferenced on the dataset; Statsmodel for trends and seasonality detection and Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) for change point detection. Analysis of data on the implemented Internet of Things technology in this experiment has achieved nonvisual detection of Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) disease on maize within four days post inoculation from monitored Volatile Organic Compounds and ultrasound emission.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things is currently one of the most representative sources of Big Data. It can acquire real-time data from multiple spatially distributed points, allowing for the extraction of valuable insights. However, an appropriate integration, processing, and analysis of these data depends on several factors starting from the correct definition of the information systems. This paper introduces STS4IoT, a UML profile and automatic code-generation tool for model-driven IoT, to address this issue. STS4IoT allows designing and implementing an IoT application from the required data only, bridging the gaps between the IoT and database design worlds. The IoT data design includes both different in-network transformations and the join of streams from multiple sources. Besides, it follows the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) guidelines to provide abstraction levels oriented to the different roles participating in the application design. The STS4IoT validation shows it has an excellent structure and is highly understandable. Its instance models are well-formed, highly abstract and readable. And the automatic implementation tool can generate complete code for complex real-world applications involving multiple IoT devices. Then, STS4IoT simplifies the definition and development of IoT applications and their integration into other information systems, such as stream data warehouses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are majorly used for remote collection and delivery of data for the operation of systems such as precision agriculture, military, e-health, and weather forecast. On most occasions, these devices are sited in remote locations without existing or reliable telecommunication networks, which makes real-time data delivery impossible. To mitigate this, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted system has been integrated into IoT data harvesting. However, this requires an authentication and key-agreement scheme capable of securing the harvested data and performing dynamic accessibility-mapping of IoT devices to a specific UAV such that each UAV will be able to identify its devices during harvesting without compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the harvested data. In this paper, we propose an authentication and key-agreement scheme for UAVs assisted IoT data harvesting. To achieve this, we developed n-Divide Loyalty Pairing (n-DLP) and a linear time sequence-based cartesian tree structure to secure the harvested data, and Chinese remainder theorem for a dynamic accessibility-mapping of different IoT devices to different UAVs. The experimental results and security analysis showed that the scheme secured the harvested data at low communication and computation overheads. Also, the results showed that the scheme has an insignificant effect on the mean waiting times of the data harvesting system.',\n",

The same applies to the agriculture industry. Every farmer has high stakes on the crops, their yield and quality. Rising water issues and need for proper methodologies for farm maintenance is a hot issue that needs to be tackled at utmost propriety. An automation of irrigation systems in farms is proposed in this research. The proposed solution is based on the Internet of Things (IoT), which would be a cheaper and more precise solution to the farm needs. A Monitoring system whose main purpose is to solve the over irrigation, soil erosion and crop-specific irrigation problem will be developed to ease and efficiently manage Irrigation problems. Since it is a well-known fact that the water is a scarce resource and over wastage of such an essential resource should be minimized. The proposed solution will be developed by establishing a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN), wherein each region of the farm would be covered by various sensor modules which will be transmitting data on a common server. Machine learning (ML) algorithms will support predictions for irrigation patterns based on crops and weather scenarios. So, a sustainable approach to irrigation is provided in this paper.',\n",

It is one of the hot spots for the government and residents. In addition to the rapid development of e-commerce and the continuous improvement of consumption levels of urban and rural populations, the quality and safety of agricultural products pose new risks and new hidden dangers. The purpose of this paper is to study the quality and safety of e-commerce agricultural products based on 5G Internet of Things technology. This paper mainly studies and uses the key technologies of 5G Internet of Things to build a circulation information system for agricultural products based on 5G Internet of Things, so as to realize the real-time positioning, information sharing and security of circulation in the supply chain of agricultural products. Experiments show that 5g Internet of things can not only provide agricultural producers, sellers and ordinary users with more efficient, convenient and accurate quality and safety information of agricultural products, but also improve the efficiency of agricultural products circulation and effectively reduce the cost of agricultural products circulation. In this paper, the RFID technology of 5G Internet of Things is used. The experimental result is that the revenue growth rate of the e-commerce business is 30\\\\%.

       "  'abstract': \"The emergence of smart cities is an example of how new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), have facilitated the creation of extensive interconnected and intelligent ecosystems. The widespread deployment of IoT devices has enabled the provision of constant environmental feedback, thereby facilitating the automated adaptation of associated systems. This has brought about a fundamental transformation in the way contemporary society functions. The security of emerging technologies such as IoT has become a significant challenge due to the added complexities, misconfigurations, and conflicts between modern and legacy systems. This challenge has a notable impact on the reliability and accessibility of existing infrastructure. Edge computing (EC) is a collaborative computing system that brings data processing and analysis closer to the edge of the network, where the data is generated, rather than in a centralized cloud environment. The utilization of the IoT has become more prevalent in both everyday life and the manufacturing sector, with a particular emphasis on critical infrastructure. The IoT is presently being utilized across diverse domains, including but not limited to industrial, agricultural, healthcare, and logistical sectors. The security of IoT networks has implications for the safety of individuals, the security of the nation, and economic development. Notwithstanding, conventional intrusion detection techniques that rely on centralized cloud-based systems that have been suggested in previous studies for IoT network security are insufficient to meet the requirements for data confidentiality, network capacity, and prompt responsiveness. In addition, the integration of IoT applications into smart devices has been shown to augment their functionalities. However, it is important to note that this integration also brings about potential security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a significant number of contemporary IoT devices exhibit restricted security capabilities, rendering them vulnerable to intricate attacks and impeding the extensive integration of IoT technologies. Also, a lot of IoT network devices have been put in place that don't have hardware security measures. This means that traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) aren't enough to protect the IoT network ecosystem. To address these issues, this research suggests the IoT-Defender framework, which combines a Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) model with a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to find cyberattacks in IoT networks. This research represents a pioneering attempt to employ the MGA for feature selection and the GA for fine-tuning the LSTM parameters within an EC framework. The parameters of the LSTM model were fine-tuned through the manipulation of the number of hidden layers, utilizing the GA fitness function. The customization of the MGA aimed to enhance its performance in selecting relevant features, optimizing the use of limited resources on IoT devices and edge nodes. The fine-tuning process involved optimizing hyperparameters, architecture, and training strategies to maximize the LSTM network's effectiveness in learning and detecting patterns in IoT network traffic. The synergy between the MGA and LSTM aimed at creating a comprehensive and efficient IDS. The feature selection by the MGA contributes to improving the LSTM’s performance by providing it with more relevant and discriminating features. In order to solve the issue of class imbalance, we utilize the focal loss function, which provides greater weights to minority classes, hence improving the model’s capacity to learn from those particular classes. The performance of the IoT-Defender model was assessed on the BoT-IoT, UNSW-NB15, and N-BaIoT datasets utilizing a Raspberry Pi IoT device. The results of our study show that the IoT-Defender model works better than other methods. This is shown by its accuracy score of 99.41\\\\%, detection rate of 99.78\\\\%, precision score of 98.50\\\\%, false alarm rate of 2.56\\\\%, mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.68, and training time of 81.3 seconds on BoT-IoT. The proposed IoT model is designed to be lightweight and can be installed on edge servers to detect cyber-attacks in real-time, specifically in the context of IoT security.\",\n",

With the rapid increase in population, the objectives of the future agro-industry are to reduce product loss while increasing product quality and productivity considerably. Consequently, farmers need to be assisted with cutting-edge technologies for sustainable, eco-friendly, and efficient farming. Smart farming for early disease recognition and control is the current hot-spot research objective in the fruitage domain. The precision agriculture era has been revolutionized by federating cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and, the Internet-of-Things. However, the existing studies focused on the impact of individual technology on single or multiple cultivars of edible fruits or vegetables. Limited areas of the fruitage disease remain explored, necessitating further investigation into the research gaps and challenges identified for implementing the smart practices in real-field farmlands. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in fruit and vegetable disease identification and classification is presented. The technology-wise state-of-the-art findings, gaps, challenges, and future opportunities for fruitage disease recognition have been presented, covering 99 research articles. Moreover, the corpus of publicly available fruit and vegetable datasets has been investigated, with the existing gaps, improvements, and future requirements.

       "  'abstract': \"Precision Agriculture (PA) is a relatively new farming approach, applying science and technology to enhance cost-effectiveness and improve food security by optimizing agricultural practices through the treatment of each crop individually. To support the new practice, an AI-based, responsive monitoring algorithm, called the Dynamic-Adaptive Search algorithm, has been developed to minimize operation costs with the benefit of acquiring new and timely information. Three modules of the algorithm are 1) Module for image processing based on AI, 2) Module for error-responsive search expansion, and 3) Module for estimating stress propagation. Computational experiments have demonstrated that the newly developed algorithm outperforms other alternatives, yielding significantly higher system performance and system gain, compared to other algorithms. The sensitivity analysis confirms the algorithm's ability to deliver within ± 10\\\\% of the theoretical optimal value, resulting in economic benefits under varying conditions. The algorithm's applications can be extended to other decision-making situations involving cost-benefit tradeoffs of acquiring more data.\",\n",

However, assessing its technological maturity in organizations is complex because of the need for standardized mechanisms, adequate tools, and rapid growth. This study aims to consolidate and analyze the existing knowledge in the field to support measuring technological maturity in the domain. A systematic literature review was conducted following the methodology proposed by Petersen to synthesize and analyze the state of the art in the area. The study retrieved 1,375 documents from seven bibliographic databases and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 58 primary studies were selected. The main results show a diversity of approaches, mechanisms, and dimensions to estimate the technological maturity of the Internet of Things in enterprises, but also a need for more empirical evidence, practical implementations, and a lack of standardization in the proposals, which limits their possibilities. The most important conclusion is that the domain matures but requires further multidisciplinary research to address the identified challenges and gaps.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, modern agriculture is moving in the direction of 4.0. The Agricultural IoT is inseparable from wireless communication. However, in traditional agricultural IoT router and gateway site selection, the influence of the actual terrain on transmission loss is not considered, which results in node power wastage and increased maintenance costs. Based on a multi-sensor fusion algorithm, a fast terrain sampler is designed in this study to collect point-cloud data of the experimental site terrain. A reasonable objective function is then designed under the premise of consideration of the electromagnetic wave free-space and diffraction losses, and the locations of the routers and gateway are optimized based on k-means and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Simulations show that the running time of the PSO algorithm is very sensitive to the changes in the execution parameters, and the improved PSO algorithm converges faster than the genetic algorithm (GA) in all three initialization methods. After collecting field terrain data, five interpolation methods were compared, and the nearest-neighbor algorithm is used to obtain the terrain model. On-site collection of received signal-strength indication (RSSI) shows that the communication quality of the optimal point selected via this algorithm is significantly higher than those of nearby points. At the same time, it is proved that the RSSI data has serious discontinuities, so the traditional gradient descent method is not suitable for solving the objective function in this work. Therefore, the algorithm used herein is of great significance for the site selection of agricultural Internet of Things nodes. However, since there are many ways to calculate the diffraction loss, the objective function of this work still needs more correction studies. The tool proposed in this work can obtain a 3D model of farmland faster than traditional surveying and mapping methods. With future research, the 3D model may be applied to soil moisture analysis, rainfall and moisture direction inversion, and plant light exposure prediction.',\n",

Since late 2018, researchers and telecom players have been actively exploring the potential of 6G as a successor to 5G. It is anticipated that the 6G generation would have even more severe performance criteria than the 5G generation had. New sophisticated technologies and paradigms must be included into 6G network designs and procedures to satisfy the requirements and standards of the sixth generation. As a result, several publications and studies covering the relevant technologies, techniques, algorithms, and architectures have appeared in the recent few years. The current paper fills a gap in the literature by offering informative recommendations for further study of 6G networks. Connectivity targets within 6G are outlined, and the study explains the wireless progression toward 6G networks. The technologies are outlined, as are the obstacles that must be surmounted. This chapter also provides a thorough and up-to-date overview of the state of the art. Additionally, multiple classifications of 6G capabilities and techniques are provided, with an emphasis on the advantages and disadvantages of each process. In order to accelerate the advancement of 6G technologies and fulfill their needs, we also identify open problems and potential future possibilities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used in agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) to observe crop data, that has improved the output and quality of agricultural product. However, the connectivity of WSNs in agricultural IoT will encounter new challenges when a farmland is segmented into multiple isolated sub-sensor networks (MISN) due to natural environmental factors. In order to tackle this issue, a new definition of connectivity in MISN is proposed, and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted connectivity enhancement algorithms (UCE) are designed. Our target is to minimize energy consumption of the UAV while satisfying MISN connectivity requirements. Firstly, the destination selection ant colony optimization algorithm (DSACO) and the normalized ant colony optimization algorithm (NACO) are proposed to connect all the sub-sensor networks. Through comparative analysis of them, the optimal path for the UAV to solve the above optimization problem is found. Secondly, autonomously generated optimal point ant colony optimization algorithm (AGOP) is proposed to connect non-communicable nodes within each sub-sensor network. Simulation results show that the complexity of the three algorithms is low, and they can complete the connectivity enhancement task of a large outdoor MISN with reduced energy consumption of the UAV, and the connectivity of the MISN has been significantly improved.',\n",

RS scene classifier that purposes for classifying scene types for RS images has wide applications in several domains like urban planning, national defence security, environmental monitoring, and natural hazard detection. State-of-the-art deep learning (DL) successes are performed in a novel wave of RS scene classification applications, but it is the absence of explainability and trustworthiness. An intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a vital role to ensure security in the RS-based IoT environment. In this aspect, this study presents an ebola optimization algorithm with deep learning-based scene classification and intrusion detection (EOADL-SCID) technique on IoT-enabled remote sensing images. The aim of the EOADL-SCID system lies in the effectual scene classification of remote sensing images and intrusion detection. It involves a two-stage procedure. In the initial stage, the EOADL-SCID algorithm involves a modified DarkNet-53 feature extractor, EOA-based hyperparameter tuning, and graph convolution network (GCN) based classification. Next, in the second stage, the intrusion detection process takes place via two subprocesses namely variational autoencoder (VAE) based intrusion detection and skill optimization algorithm (SOA) based parameter tuning. The simulation outcomes of the EOADL-SCID approach are tested utilizing two benchmark databases and the experimental outcomes highlighted the improved performance of the EOADL-SCID algorithm on scene classification and intrusion classification processes.',\n",

This study aims to identify the important barriers to the adoption of IoT in the circular economy in the manufacturing sector. To this end, a survey study was conducted to construct a framework for the evaluation of the IoT adoption barriers in the circular economy. Therefore, a novel method integrating the Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) methods based on Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PFSs) was proposed. In this method, the SWARA model is used to estimate the significance degree or weighting degrees of the barriers, while the CoCoSo method is applied to ranking various organizations in the manufacturing sector under the identified barriers. To show the performance of the developed approach, a comparison analysis is performed of the selection of qualified organizations. The outcome of this study indicated that the developed approach was able to suggest more realistic performance under PFSs, hence providing a wide range of applications.',\n",

Therefore, agriculture plays a significant role in the country’s growth. The government’s growth is constantly hampered by issues that relate to agriculture. A feasible solution to this issue is to opt for developed and modern farming that includes modern trends. Thus, the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to smart agriculture. Smart farming increases crop production, decreases water wastage, and minimizes excessive fertilizer usage. With the aid of detectors, this IoT-based system can help farms track terrain requirements anywhere and can even irrigate fields using an automatic device. World agriculture’s future needs to be sorted out through awareness and unnecessary cessation technology that can increase productivity and, in turn, restore farmers’ interest in this sector. So these smart farming strategies will help farmers minimize scrap and increase efficiency. It is certainly a glorified tech and capital-intensive crop cultivation system for the general public in a responsible way. The problems like adverse weather conditions, enviromental effect on cultivation, etc. that farmers are facing inspired us for the suggested programs that are: Global farming is on the snag due to the limited technical awareness of best and productive farming methods and furthermore they are still relying on traditional farming methods that lead to lower crop productivity. This chapter addresses a methodology to solve these problems by considering different agricultural parameters that influence yields; this also uses a GPS system to obtain geolocation data. Furthermore, it sends all information to the server where it can be investigated further. Finally, this methodology also includes a mobile application that provides the farmer with convenient access to the data.',\n",

In addition, a combined model of air quality forecasting based on machine learning is proposed to resolve real air quality monitoring challenges in environmental protection, namely, the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise-whale optimization algorithm-extreme learning machine (ICEEMDAN-WOA-ELM). On this basis, deep learning is introduced to establish a deep learning-based time-space-type-meteorology (TSTM) model to predict air quality. Finally, the model is verified by experiments. The results demonstrate that the ICEEMDAN-WOA-ELM model significantly outperforms a single AI model in air quality forecasting. The five evaluation index values of ICEEMDAN-WOA-ELM are 14.187, 17.235, 0.140, 0.067, and 0.946, which are higher than those of the other models. The single-step accuracy and average of the TSTM model in the heavily polluted weather forecast results almost reached full marks, with a maximum of 1.00. The performance also decreases with the growth of the step size but remains above 0.86. It can be seen that a single AI model can no longer meet the requirements of air quality forecasting.

       "  'abstract': 'The role of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in precision agriculture and smart greenhouses has been reinforced by recent R\\\\&D projects, growing commercialization of IoT infrastructure, and related technologies such as satellites, artificial intellige nce, sensors, actuators, uncrewed aerial vehicles, big data analytics, intelligent machines, and radio-frequency identification devices. Even though the integration of intelligent technologies offers unlimited potential in precision commercial agriculture, optimal resource management remains a challenge considering that IoT infrastructure is unevenly distributed across the world and concentrated in high-income countries. The utilization of IoT technologies in smart greenhouses often involves a tradeoff between the cost of agricultural production, environmental conservation, ecological degradation, and sustainability. The installation of IoT infrastructure is capital-intensive and often translates to higher energy demand, that elevates the risk for climate change. The widespread use of IoT sensors and networks also increases new challenges in the management of electronic waste, depletion of finite resources, and destruction of fragile ecosystems, resulting in climate change. the integration of IoT systems in greenhouses would be augmented by the global deployment of advanced 5G technology and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation broadband internet with low latency and high speeds. Intelligent application of agrochemicals could yield significant savings (500/acre or more), while need-based irrigation and fertilizer application would help improve crop yields. Globally, the deployment of IoT infrastructure would yield about 500 billion of added value to the GDP by 2030. The forecasted economic benefits affirm that the applications of IoT for optimized greenhouse environment and resources management were sustainable, and any potential risks are incomparable to the long-term benefits in commercial agriculture. The review article contributes new insights on the role of IoT in agriculture 4.0, the challenges, and future prospects for developing nations, which lacked the resources to invest in precision agriculture technologies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Technological advancements have always been influencing our lives. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain (BC) are emerging as potentially disruptive technologies. Whereby, the IoT is a system of inter-related devices with unique identifiers for data sharing and device management and control. IoT is based on the integration of traditional technologies including embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, and automation. While, the concept of IoT is continuously evolving with the convergence of multiple technologies including real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensor, and embedded systems. On the other hand, BC technology is a distributed ledger used to maintain the transaction logs of a network, and it has started revolutionizing data provenance, storage, secure, and traceable transaction management systems. There is limited use of blockchain technology for a fully decentralized, untrusted, and secure environment in the field of IoT. This article reviews the current state-of-art blockchain technology and its current utilization in different application domains of IoT. Furthermore, it presents the use of blockchain technology with digital ledger technology (DLT) and IoT. Similarly, the notable challenges of BC and IoT integration are presented. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such SLR available that provides a comprehensive review in this domain. Applying blockchain to solve IoT problems improves IoT security. Moreover, a taxonomy of application domains is presented, which can be integrated with BC and IoT. The article identifies and discusses open research issues and challenges that need to be addressed to harness the potential of BC technology for IoT.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for safeguarding crop yield, especially in regions vulnerable to food insecurity, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. One of the significant contributors to maize crop yield loss is the Northern Leaf Blight (NLB), which traditionally takes 14–21 days to visually manifest on maize. This study introduces a novel approach for detecting NLB as early as 4–5 days using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, which can identify the disease before any visual symptoms appear. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, nonvisual measurements of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and ultrasound emissions from maize plants were captured and analyzed. A controlled experiment was conducted on four maize varieties, and the data obtained were used to develop and validate a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for VOC classification and an LSTM model for ultrasound anomaly detection. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model, enhanced with wavelet data preprocessing, achieved an F1 score of 0.96 and an Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 1.00. In contrast, the LSTM model exhibited an impressive 99.98\\\\% accuracy in identifying anomalies in ultrasound emissions. Our findings underscore the potential of IoT sensors in early disease detection, paving the way for innovative disease prevention strategies in agriculture. Future work will focus on optimizing the models for IoT device deployment, incorporating chatbot technology, and more sensor data will be incorporated for improved accuracy and evaluation of the models in a field environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Automatic crop disease recognition in the wild is a challenging topic in modern intelligent agriculture due to the appearance variances and cluttered background among crop diseases. To overcome these obstacles, the popular methods are to design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that extracts visual features and identifies crop disease images based on these features. These methods work well on laboratory environment under simple background but achieve low accuracy and poor robustness in processing the raw images captured from practical fields that contain inevitable noises. In this case, Internet of Things (IoT) is attracting increasing attention, with many alternatives to collect high-level contextual information that helps modern recognition system to effectively identify crop diseases in the wild. Motivated by the usefulness of agricultural IoT, a deep learning system using a novel approach named Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN), is developed to be deployed in agricultural IoT towards practical crop disease recognition in the wild. Our MCFN firstly adopts a standard CNN backbone to extract highly discriminative and robust visual features from over 50,000 in-field crop disease samples. Next, we exploit contextual features collected from image acquisition sensors as prior information to assist crop disease classification and reduce false positives in our presented ContextNet. Finally, a deep fully connected network is designed to fuse visual features as well as contextual features and output the crop disease prediction. Experimental results on 77 common crop diseases captured in our newly built domain specific dataset show that MCFN with the deep fusion model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in wild crop disease recognition, and achieves a good identification accuracy of 97.5\\\\%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Machine learning (ML) can make use of agricultural data related to crop yield under varying soil nutrient levels, and climatic fluctuations to suggest appropriate crops or supplementary nutrients to achieve the highest possible production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of five distinct ML models for a dataset sourced from the Kaggle repository to generate practical recommendations for crop selection or determination of required nutrient(s) in a given site. The datasets contain information on NPK, soil pH, and three climatic variables: temperature, rainfall, and humidity. The models namely Support vector machine, XGBoost, Random forest, KNN, and Decision Tree were trained using yields of individual data sets of 11 agricultural and 10 horticultural crops, as well as combined yield of both agri-horticultural crops. The results strongly suggest to evaluate individual data sets separately for each crop category rather than using combined the data sets of both categories for better predictions. Comparing the five ML models, the XGBoost demonstrated the highest level of accuracy. The precision rates of XGBoost for recommending agricultural crops, horticultural crops, and a combination of both were 99.09 \\\\% (AUC 1.0), 99.3 \\\\% (AUC 1.0), and 98.51 \\\\% (AUC 0.99), respectively.

MQTT is a de facto standard, lightweight, and reliable protocol for machine-to-machine communication, widely adopted in IoT networks. Various smart devices within these networks are employed to handle sensitive information. However, the scale and openness of IoT networks make them highly vulnerable to security breaches and attacks, such as eavesdropping, weak authentication, and malicious payloads. Hence, there is a need for advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Existing ML-based IoT-IDSs face several limitations in effectively detecting malicious activities, mainly due to imbalanced training data. To address this, this study introduces a transformer neural network-based intrusion detection system (TNN-IDS) specifically designed for MQTT-enabled IoT networks. The proposed approach aims to enhance the detection of malicious activities within these networks. The TNN-IDS leverages the parallel processing capability of the Transformer Neural Network, which accelerates the learning process and results in improved detection of malicious attacks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, it was compared with various IDSs based on ML and DL approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TNN-IDS outperforms other systems in terms of detecting malicious activity. The TNN-IDS achieved optimum accuracies reaching 99.9\\\\% in detecting malicious activities.',\n",

The approach related to Precision Beekeeping is based on methodologies to mitigate the stress associated with human intervention in the colonies and the waste of resources. These goals are achieved by supporting the intervention and managing the beekeeper's timely and appropriate action at the colony's level. In recent years, the growth of IoT (Internet-of-Things) in Precision Agriculture has spurred several proposals to contribute to the paradigm of Precision Beekeeping, built on different technical concepts and with different production costs.

       "  'abstract': 'With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), there are several challenges pertaining to security in IoT applications. Compared with the characteristics of the traditional Internet, the IoT has many problems, such as large assets, complex and diverse structures, and lack of computing resources. Traditional network intrusion detection systems cannot meet the security needs of IoT applications. In view of this situation, this study applies cloud computing and machine learning to the intrusion detection system of IoT to improve detection performance. Usually, traditional intrusion detection algorithms require considerable time for training, and these intrusion detection algorithms are not suitable for cloud computing due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of cloud nodes; therefore, it is necessary to study intrusion detection algorithms with low weights, short training time, and high detection accuracy for deployment and application on cloud nodes. An appropriate classification algorithm is a primary factor for deploying cloud computing intrusion prevention systems and a prerequisite for the system to respond to intrusion and reduce intrusion threats. This paper discusses the problems related to IoT intrusion prevention in cloud computing environments. Based on the analysis of cloud computing security threats, this study extensively explores IoT intrusion detection, cloud node monitoring, and intrusion response in cloud computing environments by using cloud computing, an improved extreme learning machine, and other methods. We use the Multi-Feature Extraction Extreme Learning Machine (MFE-ELM) algorithm for cloud computing, which adds a multi-feature extraction process to cloud servers, and use the deployed MFE-ELM algorithm on cloud nodes to detect and discover network intrusions to cloud nodes. In our simulation experiments, a classical dataset for intrusion detection is selected as a test, and test steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and result analysis are performed. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect and identify most network data packets with good model performance and achieve efficient intrusion detection for heterogeneous data of the IoT from cloud nodes. Furthermore, it can enable the cloud server to discover nodes with serious security threats in the cloud cluster in real time, so that further security protection measures can be taken to obtain the optimal intrusion response strategy for the cloud cluster.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Oil palms are one of the essential crops in agricultural productivity for developing countries such as Malaysia and other tropical areas. For predicting the yield and production of palm oil, the counting process is often carried out. Manually counting oil palm trees is one of the solutions but it requires a massive labour force, and the result is often inaccurate. To overcome this problem, automated techniques for oil palm detection have been developed. However, the performance of existing automated techniques for oil palm detection deteriorates when the planting layout of the oil palm tree is not well organized. Deep learning applications for oil palm tree detection and counting offer a powerful solution to the challenges of precision agriculture, enabling plantations to increase productivity and sustainability while reducing costs and manual labour. Deep structured learning, more generally deep learning is one of the widely used computer vision technology, especially in agricultural engineering. Deep learning method is an essential tool when it comes to monitoring the plantation. Different deep learning networks are utilized for classification tasks towards oil palm trees. In order to promote the use of deep learning in the oil palm industry, this paper main contribution is to provide an understanding of the utilisation of deep learning and its application in oil palm tree counting.

       "  'abstract': 'The demand for freshwater resources has increased in recent times and has been exacerbated by escalating global population and increasing drought indices in the world’s agricultural zones. Irrigated agriculture is inevitably a wasteful water user that has deprived other sectors of the scarce resource. Improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is therefore crucial for sustainable agricultural production to thrive. There is potential to improve water use efficiency through smart irrigation systems, especially with the advent of wireless communication technologies, monitoring systems, and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation scheduling. This paper reviews state-of-the-art smart monitoring and irrigation control strategies that have been used in recent years for irrigation scheduling. From the literature review, closed-loop irrigation control strategies are efficient than open-loop systems which do not cater for uncertainties. It is argued that combining soil-based, plant, and weather-based monitoring methods in a modelling environment with model predictive control can significantly improve water use efficiency. This review shall help researchers and farmers to choose the best irrigation monitoring and control strategy to improve irrigation scheduling in open field agricultural systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is an evolutionary extension of the traditional Internet of Things (IoT) into processes and machines for applications in the industrial sector. The IIoT systems generate a large amount of private and sensitive data i.e., stored and processed somewhere on the cloud-edge continuum. The IIoT devices, and the IIoT networks are subject to security mechanisms such as intelligent Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) systems, that can detect and respond unseen malicious network attacks. The adoption of centralized machine learning methods for IDS has become impractical due to the high computational cost and privacy concerns associated with storing large amounts of data on a single server along the cloud-edge continuum. The combination of federated learning and Blockchain has emerged as a promising advancement in addressing the challenge. Federated learning distributes learning to individual IIoT devices without compromising data privacy, while Blockchain enhances privacy and security. Many academic and industrial efforts outline IDS mechanisms using machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, and Blockchain technologies. The utilization of federated learning-based IDS has become increasingly popular and is now being applied to various tasks including IDS/IPS systems. However, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) survey are limited to the scope of classical machine learning and deep learning. To address this limitation, we analyze the IIoT literature that integrates Blockchain and federated learning to enhance IDSs and improve its threat detection capabilities. This survey explores the role of Blockchain and federated learning in addressing security and privacy issues, particularly those associated with IDS/IPS in IIoT networks. Insights on the possibilities of machine learning, federated learning, and Blockchain in supporting IDS to monitor IIoT network traffic for anomaly detection are discussed in detail through state of the art. Furthermore, we provide a set of recommendation based on our literature for the effective implementation of a Blockchain and federated learning-based network intrusion detection system. Finally, we summarize the study and highlight challenges as future research directions for Blockchain and Federated Learning-based technologies for cybersecurity and intrusion detection in IIoT.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The creation of smart greenhouses is playing a crucial role in paving the way toward precision agriculture characterized by enhanced efficiency. Integral to these greenhouses are decision-support systems that leverage sophisticated forecasting algorithms to predict a range of parameters. However, these predictors often employ a single model approach for forecasting all variables of interest, leading to imbalanced predictions where some variables are accurately predicted while others do not. Such inconsistencies can undermine the overall reliability of the decision-support systems. Addressing this challenge, this paper proposes an approach that harnesses the potential of multiple deep-learning models operating concurrently to predict a broad array of environmental parameters within a smart and operational greenhouse. Each model is specifically tailored to concentrate on a distinct subset of target variables, thus ensuring that the overall accuracy of the prediction is optimized. The effectiveness of this approach has been evaluated in a real-world greenhouse setting. The results indicate a substantial improvement, exhibiting more than an 8\\\\% enhancement in the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to a single-model alternative, particularly in predicting specific environmental variables, confirming the potential for more reliable and precise agricultural decision-support systems.',\n",

Typical examples are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) that are deployed for rapid disaster response, photogrammetry, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. To support the flourishing development of Machine Learning assisted applications across all these networked applications, a common challenge is the provision of a persistent service, i.e., a service capable of consistently maintaining a high level of performance, facing possible failures. To address these service resilient challenges, we propose APRON, an edge solution for distributed and adaptive task planning management in a network of IoT devices, e.g., drones. Exploiting Jackson’s network model, our architecture applies a novel planning strategy to better support control and monitoring operations while the states of the network evolve. To demonstrate the functionalities of our architecture, we also implemented a deep-learning based audio-recognition application using the APRON NorthBound interface, to detect human voices in challenged networks.

       "  'abstract': 'Early diagnosis of plant diseases is essential in reducing economic losses for farmers and increasing production efficiency. Therefore, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems supported by artificial intelligence technologies can be developed to help diagnose diseases quickly and accurately by examining the symptoms and signs in plant leaves. In this study, Multi-head Attention Mechanism Depthwise Separable Convolution Inception Reduction Network (MDSCIRNet) architecture, an image-based deep convolutional neural network, is proposed for classifying potato leaf diseases. The main components of the MDSCIRNet architecture are depthwise separable convolution (DSC) and a multi-head attention mechanism. The proposed architecture has been compared with modern algorithms developed with DSC technology, such as Xception, MobileNet, and deep learning algorithms, such as ResNet101, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB2, to evaluate its performance in the classification process. In addition, hybrid methods developed with the classical machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and MDSCIRNet model, integrated deep learning model, hard voting ensemble learning model. Suggested methods such as these were also used in the experimental process. Moreover, techniques such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN), and Hypercolumn were used to improve the image quality of the data set. In the experimental process, the MDSCIRNet deep learning architecture achieved 99.24\\\\% accuracy in the study using the original dataset. While a 99.11\\\\% accuracy rate was achieved with the integrated deep learning model and hard voting ensemble learning model, the highest success rate of 99.33\\\\% was performed in the study conducted with the MDSCIRNet + SVM method. This study contributes to developing new and effective strategies in the agricultural industry for the early diagnosis and control of potato plant diseases. Machine learning-based approaches offer the potential to minimize economic losses and increase productivity in production by allowing farmers to intervene early.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recently, the population density in cities has increased at a higher pace. According to the United Nations Population Fund, cities accommodated 3.3 billion people (54\\\\%) of the global population in 2014. By 2050, around 5 billion people (68\\\\%) will be residing in cities. In order to make lifestyles in cities more comfortable and cost-effective, the city must be smart and intelligent. It is mainly accomplished through an intelligent decision-making process using computational intelligence-based technologies. This paper explored how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in the smart city concept. From 2014 to 2021, we examined 133 articles (97\\\\% of Scopus and 73\\\\% of WoS) in healthcare, education, environment and waste management, agriculture, mobility and smart transportation, risk management, and security. Moreover, we observed that the healthcare (23\\\\% impact), mobility (19\\\\% impact), privacy and security (11\\\\% impact), and energy sectors (10\\\\% impact) have a more significant influence on AI adoption in smart cities. Since the epidemic hit cities in 2019, the healthcare industry has intensified its AI-based advances by 60\\\\%. According to the analysis, AI algorithms such as ANN, RNN/LSTM, CNN/R-CNN, DNN, and SVM/LS-SVM have a higher impact on the various smart city domains.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart farming solutions combine information, data software tools, and technology with the intent to improve agricultural production. While smart farming concepts are well described in the literature, the potential societal impacts of smart farming are less conspicuous. To demonstrate how smart farming solutions could influence future agricultural production, agri-business and rural communities and their constituents, this article compares smart farming approaches and reasons behind the pursuit of smart farming solutions by the U.S. and South Korea. The article compares agricultural assets and productivity among the two countries as well as the technical and societal challenges impacting agricultural production as a basis to understanding the motivations behind and pathways for developing smart farming solutions. In doing so, the article compares some of the technological and social advantages and disadvantages of smart farming, dependending on the choice and implementation of smart farming solutions. The South Korean government has implemented a national policy to establish smart farming communities; a concept that addresses the entire agri-food supply chain. In the U.S., a national plan to develop smart farming technologies does not exist. However, discrete smart farming solutions driven mainly by competition in the private sector have resulted in high-tech solutions that are advancing smart farming concepts. The differences in approaches and reporting of successes and failures between the two countries could facilitate the rate of evolution of successful smart farming solutions, and moreover, could provide pathways to facilitate sustainable development goals in developing countries where smart farming activities are currently underway.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"As a controllable environment, greenhouse has less resource consumption and emission than field crop production and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production. Besides, the greenhouse with an intelligent monitoring system has better energy-saving and emission reduction effects. Simultaneously, the intelligent monitoring system can predict the extreme greenhouse environment in advance, reduce diseases and insect pests, reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and provide high-quality food. Researchers are becoming more and more interested in greenhouse monitoring systems, and how to put them into production correctly and effectively is a major challenge. This paper aims to review the intelligent greenhouse monitoring system systematically, serve the data transmission and server processing subsystems by identifying, listing and further explaining the greenhouse environmental parameters and studying the overall design of the greenhouse monitoring system. According to the characteristics of each component of the system, the paper makes a comparative study and obtains its development trend, summarizes the current popular technology and the future development trend of the intelligent monitoring system, and provides support for the research of greenhouse monitoring system. It was found that multi-parameter monitoring is beneficial to achieve effective greenhouse control, and wireless technology has gradually replaced wired mode for data transmission in the environment both inside and outside the greenhouse. Notably, deep learning, big data, and other advanced technologies used in greenhouse monitoring are considered valuable developments, further refine unmanned greenhouse management, and further improve greenhouse construction's energy utilization.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Digitalization, intelligent virtual assistants, and smart consumer products prepare us for life at every stage. Smart IoT, Sensor nodes, software communicate with one another via voice and emotions, simplifying our lives. Smart IoT is becoming more prevalent in our daily lives. Even though the use of Smart IOTs has grown in Geometric progression, the security of these devices remains traditional. Technically, most security discussions revolve around the implementation of better Network Intrusion Prevention/Detection Systems (NIPS/NIDS), the installation of a traditional firewall, or the use of proxy scanners, which is the standard recommendation of security vendors. All architectures are rooted in the same zeal that drives cyber warfare. However, when considering the Narrowband Internet of Things, the packet size is too small, and the memory and processors are so small that they cannot hold the packets for inspections, and the lucrative protocols will not work. Malicious hackers, BOTs, Trozens, and Honeypots may tamper with and virtually control these smart Internet of Things (IoT) to steal/tamper sensitive information for filthy lucre, financial reward, or, to put it simply, money in this cyber warfare. All of these issues stem from a lack of proper security design controls, architectural security flaws, and a failure to apply Secure by Design principles. Fixing these security controls earlier in the process will save us a significant amount of time, energy, and money spent on repairing broken IoT security flaws and performance aesthetics. If we consider the Shift Left Secure by Design/Architecture Journey in the Internet of Things Security Architecture, these Architectural/Design flaws can be identified in earlier stages and will help the delivery teams to plan necessary security controls in the IoT use cases.In this paper, the author discusses Layer-wise Security Challenges, Attack Vectors, and Architectural Flaws, and proposes a secure architectural solution for the Internet of Things (IoT) that assists delivery teams in securely designing/architecting resource-intensive smart Internet of Things (IoT)/Narrowband (NIoT) use cases earlier in the Life cycle by employing the Secure Design Shift Left approach. In this smart digital IoT era, the author also suggests future research directions for future generations to increase security.',\n",

The application of Distributed AI (DAI) systems like Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) opens new horizons to enhance the efficiency, responsiveness, and intelligence of these supply chains. DAI facilitates advanced autonomous decision-making and real-time optimization at different stages of the agri-food supply chain, such as demand forecasting, inventory management, production planning, logistics optimization, and quality assurance and control. This article, by focusing on the case of scheduling through the entire supply chain, examines how DAI initiatives, including Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) enhanced with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), enable the distribution of intelligence across smart, interconnected elements of the supply chain network. It is shown that through the use of DAI in SCM, the performance of the entire supply chain optimizes consistently and adaptively through the use of MAS, in which different parts of SCM collaborate as agents. Supply Chain 4.0 can gain autonomy, self-organization, self-optimization, self-adaptation, robustness, and flexibility, and its knowledge base can be enriched over time by using CBR to learn from past situations. It also discusses the opportunities and challenges associated with the adoption of DAI in Supply Chain 4.0, including operational efficiency, cost reduction, agility enhancement, and improved customer satisfaction. However, several concerns, such as data security, privacy issues, and interoperability, must be addressed.',\n",

This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption, network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail.

       "  'abstract': 'Due to the increase in world population, arable land has been reduced. Consequently, the concept of urban greenhouses is on the rise. Smart greenhouses need to monitor physical parameters for the healthy growth of plants from remote locations. A digital twin is a representation of physical assets in the digital world, and this emerging technology has opened up opportunities for efficient system development for Industry 4.0. The digital twin receives real-time operational data to monitor the asset in the digital domain. It performs real-time processing, data analysis, and machine learning to predict optimized decisions. In the era of next-generation mobile networks, IoT devices can communicate and perform their remote operations in a timely manner. In smart greenhouse technology, the digital twin could be a revolutionary substitute for real-time remote monitoring and process management. However, there has been limited work on digital twin-driven smart greenhouse technology. In this paper, a process management framework is developed that can be interpreted as a machine learning and cloud-based data-driven digital twin for smart greenhouses. The proposed framework consists of three layers: the physical, fog, and cloud layers. The physical greenhouse measurements are monitored using a highly immersive cloud-based, real-time 3D environment. We present an example architecture using commercial cloud and open-source tools to verify the proof of concept. Additionally, different ML techniques are utilized to predict the operational requirements for smart greenhouses.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Establishing a reliable, cost-effective, and data-accessible supply chain is a requirement for all administrations. The significance of such a supply chain lies in its ability to strengthen national resiliency, ensure economic security, and foster sustainable growth. Governments know financial investments and subsidies in infrastructure, logistics, and technology are necessary for a robust supply chain. This paper proposes an IoT-enabled agricultural supply chain that integrates with a cooperative Nash game between two parties: telecommunications operators and agricultural enterprises. The aim is to establish cooperative decision-making procedures in advance of the integration of blockchain technology into the supply chain, which is regulated by the subsidy policy of the government. The Nash game yields a unique Nash equilibrium, indicating that both parties can engage in cooperative negotiations regarding their participation in the blockchain application to maximize their financial profits. To illustrate the efficacy of Nash collaboration in blockchain adoption, this study presents two scenarios where non-cooperative behavior is explored to analyze stakeholder responses in competitive contexts. Numerical results justify the theoretical findings and suggest Nash cooperation among stakeholders instead of competition in the blockchain-based agri-food market, which leads to a more accessible market environment that ultimately benefits consumers. Moreover, the positive and negative aspects of the deployment of the government-supported blockchain application are derived through sensitivity analyses conducted on subsidy rate, agricultural market price, subsidy amount, and blockchain market. Practical managerial implications are derived from the findings and observations to help policymakers formulate blockchain policies in agricultural supply chains supported by governments.',\n",

Such plethora of IoT devices is expected to be impact sixth-generation (6G) networks. Securing 6G/massive IoT networks against threats, especially novel attacks, is a major challenge for 6G infrastructure to accommodate. Thus, new innovative architectures and paradigms empowered by intelligence, softwarization, and infrastructure virtualization are urgently needed. This manifestation depends upon the power of artificial intelligence integrated with key networking enablers such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) etc. to provide components of promising solutions and innovative approaches for securing the IoT. Researchers across the spectrum in computer science and engineering are striving to employ machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to improve the detection of cyber threats so that they can classify, predict, and mitigate anomalies and abnormal traffic behaviors. The challenge to design an intrusion detection system (IDS) is how to come up with a scalable solution within a realistic infrastructure architecture aimed at dealing with massive IoT applications. There is a multiplicity of factors to consider toward an optimal intelligent solution, however, we can perceive that future solutions should be tailored on native virtualized infrastructure. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study on massive IoT security aspects toward 6G networks, especially IDS systems.

       "  'abstract': \"Agriculture has undergone progressive transformations using ever-evolving technologies to increase productivity and profitability. A new approach to agricultural management based on concepts from the fourth industrial revolution is being gradually adopted. It aims to increase agricultural productivity while minimizing inputs and pollutants. Quantum computing has opened up new ventures for various fields, and one promising application is its integration into agriculture. This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of quantum computing in transforming smart agriculture practices to enhance sustainable crop management and increase yield. Traditional agriculture faces numerous challenges, including the need for more efficient resource allocation, precise monitoring of environmental conditions, and intelligent decision-making for optimal crop production. The innovation of new methods of agriculture brings into perspective how such capabilities can be integrated into crop and livestock farming to improve productivity, help control pests and diseases, and mitigate inherent risks. The research was explored through a narrative literature review and focused on developing quantum computing-based solutions for smart agriculture, including advanced optimization algorithms for resource allocation, quantum-enhanced machine learning models for crop disease prediction, and agricultural productivity, which can be assessed for climate change impact via modeling and simulation tools. Harnessing quantum systems' inherent parallelism and computational speed will provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations for maximizing yield while minimizing environmental impact. The findings indicated that quantum computing could increase the precision of monitoring crop farming initiatives, livestock farming, and agricultural productivity.\",\n",

To achieve the required quality of the IoT communication system, performance prediction is necessary; it is beneficial for fault avoidance through the dynamic and continuous adaptation of network behavior, which helps achieve sustainable improvement of IoT communication systems in smart cities. Herein, a deep-learning (DL) model to evaluate and predict the performance of an IoT communication system is proposed. In the proposed model, the number of dynamic neural networks is equal to the number of networks in the IoT system. Each neural network predicts the performance of a given IoT network. Subsequently, the performance of the entire IoT communication system can be predicted from the outputs of individual networks, which will be considered the inputs for another dynamic neural network. The proposed IoT DL model was tested using network simulator (ns-3) to construct a simulated IoT environment. The simulation results verify that the proposed DL model predicted and improved the performance of an entire simulated IoT system highly accurately.',\n",

This revolution is strengthening the farmers in terms of farm management by improving crop yield, pest control, soil health, etc. in real-time. We have thoroughly reviewed the digital adoption in terms of insights into the Indian agriculture sector and presented a comprehensive account of major ICT initiatives undertaken followed by a redundancy analysis as well as its influence on the sector. Unfortunately, while being a significant agrarian country, India's adoption of digital solutions is still in its infancy, as apparent from a close look at important FMIS and key components of recognized solutions used internationally. We found 28 FMIS solutions that are active globally, and have produced a list of 29 local (Indian) applications spread across 23 different agricultural sub-domains. Sadly, a majority among these were not unique and replicated similar features, besides just a few were found to be crop-specific applications.

In specific, we propose the UAVEC-FLchain framework for secure and efficient jujube yield estimation, consisting of the UAVEC module, data joint processing module, and data tracking module. Different UAV devices are used at edge terminals to collect distributed images of different jujube orchards, and the model is trained securely with federation learning and blockchain.

Agricultural practices with large farms are challenging to operate from remote sensing until accurate positional information is not available, which necessitates the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) for acquiring sample position using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSSs). Thus, development of positional accuracies with the help of GNSS signals has boosted up the involvement of GPS-based instruments in precision agriculture (PA). It has opened the wide door for the implementation of GPS in the PA, as per user needs and requirements. Furthermore, GPS instruments have been evolved with time, and nowadays advanced GPS instruments are in the market and can be operated via mobile with any operating systems, i.e., iOS, Android, or Windows. Availability of GPS signals in several instruments or equipment has been looked as the market opportunity and increasing trends in PA resulting in innovations of techniques for route optimization for optimal use of fertilizer spray and related activities in agricultural practices transforming to new look as SMART farming.

       "  'abstract': \"In the context of the rapidly evolving climate dynamics of the early twenty-first century, the interplay between climate change and biospheric integrity is becoming increasingly critical. The pervasive impact of climate change on ecosystems is manifested not only through alterations in average environmental conditions and their variability but also through ancillary shifts such as escalated oceanic acidification and heightened atmospheric CO2 levels. These climatic transformations are further compounded by concurrent ecological stressors, including habitat degradation, defaunation, and fragmentation. Against this backdrop, this study delves into the efficacy of advanced deep learning methodologies for the classification of land cover from satellite imagery, with a particular emphasis on agricultural crop monitoring. The study leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, namely VGG16, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and ResNet50, selected for their architectural sophistication and proven competence in image recognition domains. The research framework encompasses a comprehensive data preparation phase incorporating augmentation techniques, a thorough exploratory data analysis to pinpoint and address class imbalances through the computation of class weights, and the strategic fine-tuning of CNN architectures with tailored classification layers to suit the specificities of land cover classification challenges. The models' performance was rigorously evaluated against benchmarks of accuracy and loss, both during the training phase and on validation datasets, with preventative strategies against overfitting, such as early stopping and adaptive learning rate modifications, being integral to the methodology. The findings illuminate the considerable potential of leveraging pre-trained deep learning models for remote sensing in agriculture, demonstrating that advanced CNN architectures, particularly DenseNet121 and ResNet50, are notably effective in enhancing crop type classification accuracy from satellite imagery. This study contributes valuable insights to the field of precision agriculture, advocating for the integration of sophisticated image recognition technologies to bolster crop monitoring efficacy, thereby enabling more nuanced agricultural decision-making and resource allocation.\",\n",

This poses a challenge since regular traffic samples are typically more prevalent than anomalous traffic, and the dataset is unstructured and highly imbalanced. Our BiGAN-based model overcomes synchronization challenges between generator and discriminator networks. Training iterations increase independently until cross-entropy loss conditions are met.

The potential of this convergence to fortify security, enhance privacy, and streamline operations has ignited considerable academic interest, resulting in an impressive body of literature. However, there is a noticeable scarcity of studies employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to dissect and categorize this field. This review paper endeavours to bridge this gap by meticulously analysing a dataset of 4455 journal articles drawn solely from the Scopus database, cantered around IoT and blockchain applications. Utilizing LDA, we have extracted 14 distinct topics from the collection, offering a broad view of the research themes in this interdisciplinary domain. Our exploration underscores an upswing in research pertaining to IoT and blockchain, emphasizing the rising prominence of this technological amalgamation. Among the most recurrent themes are IoT and blockchain integration in supply chain management and blockchain in healthcare data management and security, indicating the significant potential of this convergence to transform supply chains and secure healthcare data. Meanwhile, the less frequently discussed topics include access control and management in blockchain-based IoT systems and energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks using blockchain and IoT. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply LDA in the context of IoT and blockchain research, providing unique perspectives on the existing literature.

The United Nations Organizations’ has recently defined the end of hunger and the improvement of food security in 2030 as its primary goal. Improving food security could also pass through the handling of agricultural yield. Agricultural yield is affected by climate changes since this latest decade. Climate change is considered one of the major threats to agricultural development in Africa. Decision-making level and farmers need efficient analytical tools to help them in decision making. Machine learning has become an impressive predictive analytical tool for large volume of data. It has been used in many domains such as medicine, finance, sport, and recently in agriculture. In this work, we propose three crop prediction models : Crop Random Forest, Crop Gradient Boosting Machine and Crop Support Vector Machine. We combine climate data, crop production data, and pesticides data to develop a decision system based on advanced machine learning models. Despite the poor availability of data related to agriculture in Africa, we were able to propose a decision system able to predict the crop yield at the country level in fourteen East African countries. Our experimental results show that the three proposed machine learning models fit well the crop data with a high accuracy R2. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) associated to our models are very minimal because the agricultural prediction values are very close to reality.

The research findings reveal two pathways for developing information processing capabilities through different information processing controls and networks appropriate for cooperatives (co-ops) and agricultural firms. This study contributes to the agricultural technology adoption literature by extending precision agriculture technology adoption from the adoption rate to adoption quality.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The individual and integration use of the Internet of Things (IoT), Information-Centric Networking (ICN), and Federated Learning (FL) have recently been used in several network-related scenarios and have consequently experienced a growing interest in the research community. Federated learning addresses the privacy and security issues of the IoT data in a decentralized manner. Also, it can be capable of training the multiple learning algorithms through local content except for exchanging data through intelligent Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Moreover, in ICN, the content is retrieved and stored based on the content name rather than the content location address. On the other hand, it is challenging to support the massive IoT devices by the fifth generation (5G) mobile-cellular networks. Therefore, the cellular 6G networks are expected to increase the connection capabilities by 10–100 times over 5G, which necessitates a convergence of Communication, Computing, and Caching (3C). At the same time, the in-network caching capabilities of ICN can be attractive features for IoT networks. IoT aspires to link anybody and/or everything at any time and location. However, integrating IoT with different areas is a new academic topic and is still in its infancy. As a result, this research highlights the potential of ICN for IoTs by conducting an exhaustive literature review. This work provides a comprehensive survey regarding these three recent research trends (i.e., FL, IoT, and ICN) and reviews the related state-of-the-art literature. We first describe the main features of each technology and discuss their most common and used variants. Furthermore, we envision the integration of such technologies to take advantage efficiently. Indeed, we consider their group-wise (FL-ICN-IoT) utilization based on the need for more robust security and privacy. Additionally, we cover the application fields of these technologies both individually and combinedly. Finally, we discuss the open issues of the reviewed research and describe potential directions for future avenues regarding integrating IoT, ICN, and FL technologies.',\n",

Existing wireless networks usually consist of a large number of nodes, with the potential risk of the curse of dimensionality. High dimensionality plays a negative role in learning effectiveness and efficiency, which should have been studied in depth but is neglected in existing wireless network research. In order to generate effective semantic-driven efficiency, this paper focuses on semantic-driven dimensionality reduction for wireless Internet of Things. Specifically, this paper introduces a series of feature selection techniques centered on Mahalanobis distance for dimensionality reduction, which helps to select discriminative features by measuring the effectiveness of semantic preferences and semantic-driven efficiency through Mahalanobis distance. Experiments on a set of wireless sensor data and various high-dimensional microarray data validate the superior performance of the proposed method.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The agricultural industry has enormous potential to meet the world's growing need for nutritious and healthful food. However, pests destroy a significant portion of the harvest and reduce quality; thus, farmers struggle to discover pests on their farms. Traditional pest identification methods require scientists with extensive field experience correctly identify pests based on their physical characteristics. Pesticides harm food and agriculture. IoT technology uses many affordable sensor devices to collect real-time data on pest-related agricultural development characteristics. The research paper aims to develop an AI-enabled real-time, IoT-based automatic pest detection system using sound pest analytics and IoT networks in the sizeable agricultural field. The proposed method used audio pre-processing techniques in sound analytics such as HPF, Hann window, hop window, FFT, DFT, STFT, and MFCC algorithm for denoising the pest sound, removing the spectral leakage, converting overlapping to non-overlapping frames, converting the time to the frequency domain, determining frequency spectrum, detecting sinusoidal frequency and internal component, extracting the MFCCs feature respectively. The characteristics and other statistical metrics were collected from 500 pest sounds and trained, validated, and evaluated using the CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and CNN-Bi-LSTM network models. The extracting features and different statistical measurements were compared during the testing process. The proposed system integrated the CNN and Bi-LSTM techniques called CNN-Bi-LSTM model for training, validating, and testing. From the experimental results, it has been observed that, the proposed CNN-Bi-LSTM model achieved 98.91 \\\\% accuracy, 96.8 \\\\% sensitivity, 97.96 \\\\% specificity, 98.54 \\\\% recall, 98.63 \\\\% precision, and 98.58 \\\\% F1 score, which is better compared to CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM and also existing ANN, DCNN, and VGG-16 state-of-the-art techniques.\",\n",

With the remarkable development in recent decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) based remote sensing technologies have gained rapid proliferation and exploitation in precision agriculture. Consequently, over the past decades, researchers have explored the capabilities of UAVs for real-time imagery data acquisition and processing through powerful Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to optimize agricultural process management. Being a prevalent research domain of high-tech field with constant advancement, there is a need for systematic review to recapitulate the contemporary literature and reveal the domain’s intellectual structure. This systematic literature review (SLR) research has methodically scrutinized 214 peer reviewed articles on the concerned domain that are published in ranked journals and conferences over the past 14 years. Several pressing dimensions are investigated, including, the feasibility assessment of the UAVs in precision agriculture, determine the impact of imaging modalities and imagery datasets in relation to agricultural applications, categorically evaluate the UAV configuration and offer detailed scrutiny of AI methods in relation to real-time control, decision making and action performance in agricultural applications. Alongside, the taxonomy of crops across the world is documented for which UAV is utilized. Finally, the main challenges and directions of future research along the track is presented.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Quantum computing, based on quantum mechanical principle, can potentially provide significant advantages over classical computing. This advantage of quantum computing provides solutions to many previously unsolvable problems in secure communication and finance. IoT is an emerging technology that deals with a large amount of data. The data communicated in IoT need to be secured. The existing security architecture of IoT is based on cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC. Quantum computing had a significant impact on the security of these algorithms. Therefore, our work analyses the security concerns of IoT smart applications and quantum-based solutions. This article provides a survey of quantum computing fundamentals and the impact of quantum computing on IoT security. Thus, this paper aims to provide a wide view of quantum-enabled IoT communication. The main challenges in implementing quantum-enabled communication are also analyzed in our work.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The majority of communication protocols used in IoT networks for caching and congestion control techniques were rule-based which implies that these protocols are dependent on explicitly stated static models. To solve this issue, techniques are becoming more adaptive to changes in the network environment by incorporating a learning-based approach using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Recent surveys and review papers have covered topics on the use of ML and DL in either caching or congestion control techniques used in various types of networks. However, there is not an article in the literature dedicated to surveying the design of caching and congestion control mechanisms in IoT networks from the perspective of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) problem. Hence, this work aimed to survey the state-of-the-art DRL-based caching and congestion control techniques in IoT networks from 2019 to 2023. It also presented general frameworks for DRL-based caching and congestion control techniques based on surveyed works as a baseline for designing future protocols in IoT networks. Moreover, this paper classified the parameter choices of surveyed DRL-based techniques and identified the issues and challenges behind these techniques. Finally, a discussion of the possible future directions of this research domain was presented.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The increasing demand for water and worsening climate change place significant pressure on this vital resource, making its preservation a global priority. Water quality monitoring programs are essential for effectively managing this resource. Current programs rely on traditional monitoring approaches, leading to limitations such as low spatiotemporal resolution and high operational costs. Despite the adoption of novel monitoring approaches that enable better data resolution, the public's comprehension of water quality matters remains low, primarily due to communication process deficiencies. This study explores the advantages and challenges of using Internet of Things (IoT) and citizen science as alternative monitoring approaches, emphasizing the need for enhancing public communication of water quality data. Through a systematic review of studies implemented on-field, we identify and propose strategies to address five key challenges that IoT and citizen science monitoring approaches must overcome to mature into robust sources of water quality information. Additionally, we highlight three fundamental problems affecting the water quality communication process and outline strategies to convey this topic effectively to the public.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Aquaculture, which is the breeding of fishes in artificial ponds, seems to be gaining popularity among urban and sub-urban dwellers in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Tenant aquaculture enables individuals irrespective of their profession to grow fishes locally in a little space. However, there are challenges facing aquaculture such as the availability of water, how to monitor and manage water quality, and more seriously, the problem of absence of dataset with which the farmer can use as a guide for fish breeding. Aquaponics is a system that combines conventional aquaculture with hydroponics (the method of growing plants in water i.e. soilless farming of crops). It uses these two technologies in a symbiotic combination in which the plant uses the waste from the fish as food while at the same time filtering the water for immediate re-use by the fish. This helps to solve the problem of frequent change of water. An Internet of Things (IoT) system consisting of an ESP-32 microcontroller which controls water quality sensors in aquaponics fish ponds was designed and developed for automatic data collection. The sensors include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, ammonia and nitrate sensors. The IoT system reads water quality data and uploads the same to the cloud in real time. The dataset is visualized in the cloud and downloaded for the purposes of data analytics and decision-making. We present the dataset in this paper. The dataset will be very useful to the agriculture, aquaculture, data science and machine learning communities. The insights such dataset will provide when subjected to machine learning and data analytics will be very useful to fish farmers, informing them when to change the pond water, what stocking density to apply, provide knowledge about feed conversion ratios, and in predict the growth rate and patterns of their fishes.',\n",

The drones can be further utilized to collect the data from smart devices and send to the Ground Station Server (GSS). However, insecure communication among the smart devices, drones and the GSS make the IoT agriculture environment vulnerable to various potential attacks. For this goal, a new authentication and key management scheme for IoT-enabled IPA, called AKMS-AgriIoT, has been put forward with the private blockchain-based solution.

       "  'abstract': \"Sustainable Rural Development involves eco-friendly management of Agricultural Systems while the research on Smart Farming Technologies (SFT) evolves towards that direction. A technology breakout such as Smart Farming, is lacking of feedback and network interactions, so Networking is crucial for knowledge accumulation and systems’ integration, thus, it embeds interaction between different elements, enhances feedback loops between them, integrates Research \\\\& Development and improves marketing practices. Rural development requires the insights of several established disciplines and needs to be connected to politics in order to achieve successful results, so this approach was applied. Moreover, if the goal is Sustainability, the interdisciplinarity of the involved scientists should assist policy decisions and be of use for Rural Strategic Planning. The equipment suppliers' participation in the planning of rural strategies should be explored due to the fact that the communication between them and policy makers does not always occur and their interests could conflict. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted among three groups of stakeholders- researchers, politicians and professionals in Greece; in order to explore the importance of implementing Smart Farming Technologies aiming at Sustainable Rural Development. Thematic and Content Analysis were applied. Then a Quantitative Analysis was performed in order to evaluate the stakeholders’ disagreement or consistency on their preferences in research orientation of SFTs’. The results not only indicated the challenges rural areas face in relation to the adoption of SFT, such as lack of strategic planning and necessary infrastructures, but also revealed the main reasons for underdevelopment and environmental degradation in Greece. Finally, the gap in communication and feedback between the stakeholders was confirmed. The results can be used by policy makers to customize their interventions based on the stakeholders’ priorities.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) mimics the cognitive functions of the human brain, that is, learning from experiences using a set of algorithms by identifying hidden patterns. AI has already demonstrated its game-changing capabilities in many fields such as the banking sector, healthcare, e-commerce, among others. Recent advances in both computer hardware and large-scale generation of biological data have created room for the applicability of AI in agriculture by employing methods like machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, artificial or convoluted neural networks either independently or in combination thereof. Currently, AI is being utilized in multiple domains of agriculture and contributing toward increasing crop yield as well as minimizing the risk associated with crop cultivation. Data generated from different agricultural domains such as weather, soil, temperature, humidity, irrigation, sowing requirements, and other crop-related criterion are being analyzed and integrated for agriculture-related predictions. An increase in crop yield is being achieved not only by predicting the best time for sowing, harvesting, and monitoring crop health but also by reducing the cost of agricultural inputs like chemicals, fertilizers, irrigation, etc., through precision farming. Correspondingly, agricultural risks are also being minimized by addressing issues such as poor rainfall, weed growth, pest attacks, and postharvest losses. Besides, AI is also being used for crop/commodity price forecasting and agricultural automation via robots. The predictive agricultural analytics and chatbots are used to disseminate information to farmers as a part of advisory services by these agribusinesses. This chapter will discuss AI technologies and their various applications for the development of better farm practices to improve plant productivity as well as technological advancements due to AI and its anticipated challenges in the future will be explored.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In Internet of things (IoT) and Social Internet of things (SIoT), how to select or recommend suitable smart objects from an ocean of smart objects has become an increasingly critical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called BLA (BERT and Bi-LSTM with attention) for smart objects scoring tasks to make recommendations in social Internet of things. The model uses a BERT network to obtain the sentence vectors for a smart object related text, and then uses Bi-LSTM with two types of attention mechanisms to extract representations of the smart object vectors. The devised attention mechanism contains a self-attention (SA) layer and a global-attention (GA) layer. The SA layer is able to estimate the importance of sentences or fields, which in a certain sense can substitute for manually defined features at the sentence and field level. The GA layer can measure the relationships between sentences (or fields) and user requirements, which further helps the model obtain more effective smart object vectors. The thing–thing relationship of Internet of things is introduced into the model to inprove the recommendation effect. Experimental results on the datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other baseline methods.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Internet of Things (IoT) has experienced significant growth in recent years and has emerged as a very dynamic sector in the worldwide market. Being an open-source platform with a substantial user base, Android has not only been a driving force in the swift advancement of the IoT but has also garnered attention from malicious actors, leading to malware attacks. Given the rapid proliferation of Android malware in recent times, there is an urgent requirement to introduce practical techniques for the detection of such malware. While current machine learning-based Android malware detection approaches have shown promising results, the majority of these methods demand extensive time and effort from malware analysts to construct dynamic or static features. Consequently, the practical application of these methods becomes challenging. Therefore, this paper presents an Android malware detection system characterized by its lightweight design and reliance on explainable machine-learning techniques. The system uses features extracted from mobile applications (apps) to distinguish between malicious and benign apps. Through extensive testing, it has exhibited exceptional accuracy and an F1-score surpassing 0.99 while utilizing minimal device resources and presenting negligible false positive and false negative rates. Furthermore, the classifier model's transparency and comprehensibility are significantly augmented through the application of Shapley's additive explanation scores, enhancing the overall interpretability of the system.\",\n",

But, it requires enormous manpower, huge processing time and extensive knowledge about plant diseases. Hence, machine learning is applied to identify diseases in plant leaves as it analyzes the data from diverse aspects, and classifies it into one of the predefined set of classes. The morphological features and properties like color, intensity and dimensions of the plant leaves are engaged into consideration for categorization. This paper discusses a summary on diverse types of plant diseases and different classification techniques in machine learning which are used for identifying diseases in diverse plant leaves. The blending of internet of things (IoT) with ecological sensing and image processing mechanism has opened a new era to observer the health of plants. Taxonomy of plant diseases at the initial stages using image processing and analyzing environmental sensing data not only helps farmers to obtain healthy plants but also take full advantage of the production. To screen and classify plant diseases IoT is important to send images and give feedback on it.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Raising incidents of security threats among active sessions is an increasing concern in IoT environment. Continuous authentication was introducing to be superior to traditional authentication schemes by constantly verify users’ identities on an ongoing basis and spot the moment at which an illicit attacker seizes control of the session. However, several challenges remain unsolved. This research aims to investigate the power of Blockchain technology to provide real-time and non-intrusive continuous authentication for the IoT environment. Accordingly, a distributed and scalable continuous authentication solution based on Blockchain technology called CAB-IoT was proposed. It enabled fog nodes layer that tackles the limitations of IoT resources by providing localized processing of heavy continuous authentication-related tasks for a group of IoT devices. Besides, CAB-IoT introduced a trust module that depends on the face recognition machine learning model to detect outliers and abnormal access. Moreover, mutual authentication between end-users and fog nodes is also designed, as well as secure communication between the authenticated nodes. The results demonstrate a lightweight continuous authentication solution that achieved the desired balance between security and performance requirements where it was observed in a real-world environment for truly performance results. Security analysis and attack analysis are also considered during the evaluation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'CONTEXT Automated monitoring of the soil-plant-atmospheric continuum at a high spatiotemporal resolution is a key to transform the labor-intensive, experience-based decision making to an automatic, data-driven approach in agricultural production. Growers could make better management decisions by leveraging the real-time field data while researchers could utilize these data to answer key scientific questions. Traditionally, data collection in agricultural fields, which largely relies on human labor, can only generate limited numbers of data points with low resolution and accuracy. During the last two decades, crop monitoring has drastically evolved with the advancement of modern sensing technologies. Most importantly, the introduction of IoT (Internet of Things) into crop, soil, and microclimate sensing has transformed crop monitoring into a quantitative and data-driven work from a qualitative and experience-based task. OBJECTIVE Ag-IoT systems enable a data pipeline for modern agriculture that includes data collection, transmission, storage, visualization, analysis, and decision-making. This review serves as a technical guide for Ag-IoT system design and development for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. METHODS It highlighted Ag-IoT platforms presented in 115 academic publications between 2011 and 2021 worldwide. These publications were analyzed based on the types of sensors and actuators used, main control boards, types of farming, crops observed, communication technologies and protocols, power supplies, and energy storage used in Ag-IoT platforms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The result showed that 33 variables measured by various sensors were demonstrated in these studies while 10 actuations were successfully integrated with Ag-IoT platforms. Perennial crops, which introduced less disturbance to Ag-IoT platforms than annual crops, were selected by 64\\\\% of researchers. Furthermore, studies in Ag-IoT system development were more focused on outdoor than indoor environments. Ag-IoT systems based on Arduino were most common among the studies while commercial platforms were least adopted, likely due to their inflexibility in customized developments. More researchers focused on agricultural applications than the IoT technology itself. Soil water content-based irrigation scheduling and controlled environment monitoring and controlling were the main applications. Other application areas included soil nutrient estimation, crop monitoring based on multiple vegetation indices, pest identification, and chemigation. SIGNIFICANCE Several potential future research directions were identified at the end of the review, including integration of satellite-based internet connectivity to improve the IoT networks in non-connected farms, development of mobile IoT platforms (drones and autonomous ground vehicles) with continuous connectivity, and the use of edge-computing and machine-learning/deep-learning to enhance the capability of the Ag-IoT systems.',\n",

We propose the concept of harnessing natural and artificial wind energy, the turbulence produced by the displacement of air due to the motion of objects such as trains. This energy harnessed can then be used in powering Internet of Things devices that enable AI-based smart farmland monitoring systems.

Machines with AI capabilities in a broader scope can perform tasks mimicking human brains. In this book chapter, a practical guide is provided to use AI-based algorithms in hydrological studies. Firstly, common hydrological modeling problems have been identified based on their modeling nature and categories such as regression, classification, sequence prediction, and reinforcement learning tasks. An introduction of the commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithms and libraries are discussed in the following sections to familiarize readers with the recent advancement in this specific domain. Important steps from training to implementation of ML algorithms in hydrological studies have also been discussed. A detailed review of common hydrological domains such as rainfall-runoff modeling, groundwater modeling, evapotranspiration modeling, and water resource management is summarized accordingly. In the final section of this book, some challenges implementing ML algorithms in hydrological-related studies are discussed. The chapter also presents a need to establish some ethical rules and responsible use of AI in water-related studies. The applications of ethical principles will help the water resource managers, policymakers, and government sectors to layout the framework for responsible use of AI in the water sector.',\n",

The invention of agriculture can be regarded as a key point in the timeline and dawn of modern civilization as we know it today. With the advent of digital electronics, we are now capable of carefully device systems to make any processes more optimized and generate significantly higher output, this is also true for the agriculture sector and many works are carried out recently aimed towards this objective and even created a new domain of precision agriculture. In this research work, an IoT-based system was developed that enables the farmers to monitor various micro-climatic parameters and assess the irrigation water requirement. The soil moisture and temperature were sensed with the aid of sensors and were fed to the LoRA system, in the receiver side, data is analyzed for the estimation of evapotranspiration. The global evapotranspiration was estimated using Cropwat software. The sensor data were analyzed using Mcguinnes-Bordne formulation and the outcome of this research work paves the way towards the estimation of the evapotranspiration in the microclimate environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modern approach to artificial intelligence (AI) aims to design algorithms that learn directly from data. This approach has achieved impressive results and has contributed significantly to the progress of AI, particularly in the sphere of supervised deep learning. It has also simplified the design of machine learning systems as the learning process is highly automated. However, not all data processing tasks in conventional deep learning pipelines have been automated. In most cases data has to be manually collected, preprocessed and further extended through data augmentation before they can be effective for training. Recently, special techniques for automating these tasks have emerged. The automation of data processing tasks is driven by the need to utilize large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data for machine learning and big data applications. Today, end-to-end automated data processing systems based on automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques are capable of taking raw data and transforming them into useful features for big data tasks by automating all intermediate processing stages. In this work, we present a thorough review of approaches for automating data processing tasks in deep learning pipelines, including automated data preprocessing – e.g., data cleaning, labeling, missing data imputation, and categorical data encoding – as well as data augmentation (including synthetic data generation using generative AI methods) and feature engineering – specifically, automated feature extraction, feature construction and feature selection.

       "  'abstract': 'LoRaWAN technology’s reliability is challenged by weather parameters, which can influence the communication channel design, especially when dealing with outdoor devices. We propose to analyze this effect by evaluating the relationship between the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and different weather parameters, as well as its temporal changes. A rigorous statistical analysis of the RSSI sequences is conducted to assess if they could be represented by a specific statistical model. For this purpose, several models are investigated. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms cover machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods are appealing when dealing with time series forecasting. Nevertheless, the classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model can be an attractive alternative due to its simplicity. Therefore, this work proposes a comparative study of ARIMA, AI, and hybrid approaches to forecast the RSSI using weather parameters as regressors. The considered AI algorithms are the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Also, hybrid models are constructed, coupling the ARIMA with them. The models are evaluated in time series of RSSI, measured by eight different LoRaWAN transmitter nodes and considering the temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and rain as weather parameters. Our analysis reveals that temperature is the dominant factor among weather parameters, and negatively affects RSSI. The ARIMA model that uses only the temperature as a regressor provides consistently better fits than the ARIMA without regressors. Moreover, coupling the ARIMA with the temperature as a regressor and the ANN (ARIMA-ANN) is the best option among the pure AI and hybrid approaches. However, it provided accuracy measures very close to those obtained from the ARIMA model fitted in the first stage, with similar performance. Therefore, the ARIMA model considering the temperature is the most competitive alternative when analyzing RSSI measurements, with the advantage of being the most straightforward method. These results suggest that the RSSI from the analyzed LoRaWAN receiver nodes may not present nonlinear patterns and, considering several weather parameters, they are affected mainly by the outdoor temperature.',\n",

Agriculture not only provides the fuel for billions of people but also employment opportunities to a large number of people. The agricultural industries are seeking innovative approaches for improving crop yielding because of unpredictable climatic changes, the rapid increase in population growth and food security concerns. Thus, artificial intelligence in agriculture also called “Agriculture Intelligence” is progressively emerging as a part of the industry's technological revolution. The aim of this paper is to review various applications of agriculture intelligence such as precision farming, disease detection, and crop phenotyping with the help of numerous tools such as machine learning, deep learning, image processing, artificial neural network, deep learning, convolution neural network, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology, wireless communication, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), different genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and computer vision to name a few. With the help of these technologies, the use of the colossal volume of chemicals can be used reduced, which would result in reduced expenditure improved soil fertility along with elevated productivity.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging communication paradigm due to its wide range of applications. For IoT, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are becoming increasingly widespread, and the solutions to combat these attacks are in increased demand. The significant contributions of this paper include offering a novel algorithm named DALCNN (Detecting Attack using Live Capture Neural Network) for detecting DDoS attacks in IoT using the concept of recurrent neural network and implementation of a Software-defined-Network (SDN) using OpenDayLight platform. Furthermore, a three-tier architecture is proposed to classify and detect DDoS attacks. The algorithm classifies the kind of attack using a novel activation function and the machine/deep learning concepts. The proposed classifier is tested on 177 instances. The Simulation was carried out using the tools such as Mininet, Wireshark to generate the DDoS attack and accurately detect the different types of DDoS attacks in the network. The simulation results reveal that the values of benchmark parameters – accuracy, true positive rate, false-positive rate, precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC-area are: 99.98\\\\%, 0.999, 0.01, 0.999, 0.999, 0.999, and 0.999, respectively. Apart from it, the network performance evaluation of the various open-source controllers’ including Floodlight, Ryu, ONOS, and the OpenDayLight based on the performance metrics – Throughput, Latency, and Aggregate Controller performance as well was carried out. The Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently compared to the other existing algorithms. The proposed OpenDayLight controller performs way better than the other open-source controllers.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision Agriculture is a broad, systemic, and multidisciplinary subject, dealing with an integrated information and technology management system, based on the concepts that the variability of space and time influence crop yields. Precision farming aims at more comprehensive management of the agricultural production system as a whole. It uses a set of tools, instruments, and sensors to measure or detect parameters or targets of interest in the agroecosystem. Sensors are distributed in the environment and are usually communicated through a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Due to this dispersion of the sensors, errors could occur in Byzantine form or could be caused by safety factors, which can lead to a misinterpretation by the system of data analysis and actuation over the environment. Anomaly detection algorithms can detect such problem sensors by allowing them to be replaced, or the wrong data is ignored. Therefore, this work presents a reference architecture and a heuristic algorithm that aid the decision of which anomaly detection to use based on the demands of agricultural environments. We performed a preliminary evaluation, analyzing different anomaly detection algorithms regarding execution time, accuracy, and scalability metrics. Results show that the decision-making supported by the proposed architecture reduces edge devices’ power consumption by 18.59\\\\% while minimizing the device’s temperature in up to 15.94\\\\% depending on the application workload and edge device characteristics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cyber attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) have seen a significant increase in recent years. This is primarily due to the widespread adoption and prevalence of IoT within domestic and critical national infrastructures, as well as inherent security vulnerabilities within IoT endpoints. Therein, botnets have emerged as a major threat to IoT-based infrastructures targeting firmware vulnerabilities such as weak or default passwords to assemble an army of compromised devices which can serve as a lethal cyber-weapon against target systems, networks, and services. In this paper, we present our efforts to mitigate this challenge through the development of an intrusion detection system that resides within an IoT device to provide enhanced visibility thereby achieving security hardening of such devices. The device-level intrusion detection presented here is part of our research framework BTC\\\\_SIGBDS (Blockchain-powered, Trustworthy, Collaborative, Signature-based Botnet Detection System). We identify the research challenge through a systematic critical review of existing literature and present detailed design of the device-level component of the BTC\\\\_SIGBDS framework. We use a signature-based detection scheme with trusted signature updates to strengthen protection against emerging attacks. We have evaluated the suitability and enhanced the capability through the generation of custom signatures of two of the most famous signature-based IDS with ISOT, IoT23, and BoTIoT datasets to assess the effectiveness with respect to detection of anomalous traffic within a typical resource-constrained IoT network in terms of number of alerts, detection rates, detection time as well as in terms of peak CPU and memory usage.',\n",

The proposed software product focuses on solving particular adoption-related problems that were underscored by some researchers, such as relationship difficulties between the child and adoptive parents due to the type of matching process, lack of accessibility and transparency, high expenses and time-consuming for adoptive parents, and measuring the child\\'s anxiety or stress in the trial adoption. Thus, the first software component computes the compatibility between the child and the parent, the second assesses the parent\\'s readiness for adoption, and the third employs a bracelet to track the child\\'s heart rate and monitor the progress of the trial adoption in real-time. The application \"Adopt Platform\" was built using C\\\\#, the ASP.NET and Entity Framework for Microsoft SQL database communication, and the Azure tool for artificial intelligence functions for English and Romanian languages. The paper incorporates two case studies, employing numerous tests to assess the accuracy of artificial intelligence services in recognizing forms and conducting sentiment analysis through the Azure tool. The results show that the Azure Form Recognizer effectively discerns data aligned with the Adopt Platform\\'s specifications and handles images taken within a 30 cm range. Nevertheless, it imposes constraints: images should stay within a 30° tilt from the horizontal, be within a 30 cm distance, and not contain unrelated text in the backdrop. When evaluating text lengths across English and Romanian contexts, the Azure Sentiment Analysis exhibited an average performance metric of close to 57\\\\%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agrotourism, a development in the tourism industry that can increase the economic potential of an area, offers many activities, such as fruit picking tours. Fruit picking, a crucial part of the harvesting process, involves separating fruits from plants to obtain economic value. However, several common mistakes during harvesting can damage the plants or branches. In this study, we developed a mechanical fruit harvester incorporated with the Internet of Things (IoT). The harvester has multiple functions, such as minimizing the damage to tree branches, monitoring the fruit productivity of each plant, and providing information on fruit weight and prices in real-time. The tool is equipped with a smartphone, several infrared and load sensors, a microcontroller, a cloud data logger, and a data analysis system. We tested the accuracy of the GPS on several smartphones while in agrotourism areas. The accuracy of the GPS on the harvesting tool is approximately 3 meters, and the success rate in calculating the number of fruits using the infrared sensor is 93.3 \\\\%, depending on the diameter of the fruit passing into the bucket. In addition, the harvester is equipped with a load sensor with a measurement deviation rate of 2.48\\\\%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture represents an essential aspect of human existence, providing the sustenance necessary for survival in the form of food and various other products. Additionally, it serves as a foundational pillar of economic development, offering employment and income opportunities to countless individuals. The incorporation of machine vision in agriculture has emerged as a crucial technology, enabling farmers to automate various tasks, such as crop monitoring and yield prediction using cameras and image processing techniques and even providing real-time information on crop maturity for harvest planning. This not only helps increase efficiency and productivity but also provides valuable insights for precision agriculture, enabling more quick and informed decision-making and ultimately leading to improved crop yields and financial returns. This scholarly work conducts a thorough examination of the various components that comprise a machine vision system, specifically delving into the techniques of image acquisition, processing, and classification. It also explores the methods employed within each of these techniques, and how the combination of such processes is used to perform various agricultural activities such as weeding, seeding, harvesting, fruit counting, overlapping, sorting, etc. Furthermore, it aims to guide on how the knowledge gained can be applied to build practical machine vision systems for agriculture. Additionally, this work highlights the research gaps, address current problems that can be solved and its potential for future advancement in the field of agriculture, and guides readers towards promising areas for future endeavours.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Decision Support Systems (DSS) have widely provided on intelligent human–machine interactions like the Internet of Things (IoT). As the dimensions and complexity of the IoT communications between intelligent devices, industrial equipment, sensors, and mobile applications are continuously increasing, supporting Service Level Agreements (SLA) for a large amount of cloud data centers and a huge number of user requests is going to be more challenging. This challenge would be more complicated when the energy consumption of the industrial IoT ecosystems increases exponentially as well. Therefore, DSS models are required for automated decision-making in critical IoT environments like intelligent industrial systems and smart cities. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the DSS strategies for energy-efficient IoT applications in intelligent urban computing. The main objective of this review is (1) presenting a technical taxonomy to categorize existing energy-efficient DSS models for industrial and smart environments in IoT ecosystems; (2) recognizing significant research trends in the field of energy-aware DSS strategies for intelligent urban computing in IoT and (3) presenting a technical and statistical analysis of reviewed studies and evaluation factors. Finally, innovations as forthcoming issues and new challenges of energy-based DSS strategies for intelligent urban computing in IoT are presented.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To address climate change, environmental monitoring and wellness more generally on a global scale, a new concept is presented - the bionic internet-of-things, or b-IoT. We propose the utilization of existing organic “sensor” technology that nature has provided and discuss a future adapting these to an existing inorganic internet to truly open up a global IoT. The use of organisms, in the first instance plants, bring an additional physical and psychological factor, connecting up living in things in a way that is consistent with natural symbiosis but extended over a global and potentially galactic scale. These plants not only monitor the environment, they interact to enable it to thrive, producing an ecosystem that consumes CO2, generates oxygen, recycling land and providing an environment for other organic species to develop. In contemporary real estate development, the need for a more whole ecosystem approach is recognized and that technology plays a vital role towards that. Thus, we identify wellness and wellbeing as an integral part of all future technology development. A fundamental challenge is connecting such sensors to the IoT. We briefly review technologies of relevance in the context of material, health and environmental considerations, and discuss novel transducer mechanisms. To assess sensor capability, we review our recent work on measuring leaf material properties using contact angle mapping, demonstrating a diversity of potential for environmental monitoring from this method alone. We also review some examples of common botanical properties that already exist which can in principle be readily coupled to existing transducers to create the hybrid b-IoT. We briefly speculate into the future of materials at the sensor end and into reaching space that can meet low cost and provide advanced functionality to help connectivity and integrate fibre and fibreless technologies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Network Digital Twin (NDT) and Network Simulation (NS) are two paradigms leveraging virtual representations of networks to help decision-making. These tools may seem similar or interchangeable and are often confused or opposed. However, they have their respective purposes, use cases and underlying concepts, which differ and are complementary. The goal of this article is to explore and clarify the specificity, the benefits and the limits of these two decision support tools, analyze how they complement each other and can be nicely combined. We argue that a smart integration of NS in NDT, named NS+NDT, can ease, accelerate and strength decisions for network design, deployment, operations, management and evolution. To study and demonstrate this claim, we focus on the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, where wireless networks are critical for connecting the physical assets to the Internet, but are complicated to configure for meeting the requirements of a specific application. We examine how NS, coupled with NDT, can contribute to support IoT architects and operators decisions throughout the life cycle of an IoT network. We analyse the different steps required to use NS in the context of NDT and examine how this helps remove NS barriers such as credibility and reliability. In particular, we show how NDT data enable to fine tune and customize the energy consumption models, making the simulation results more context-aware and insightful. Then, addressing the often-prohibitive simulation cost for exploring a large parameter space, we propose to associate surrogate modeling to NS+NDT. As surrogate models, we first introduce a simple ML (Machine Learning)-based surrogate model and illustrate this method with two IoT network configuration optimization use cases. Secondly, we propose a Bayesian optimization approach based on Gaussian Processes as surrogate model to further accelerate the (re)configuration decisions. We show how this method enables to select simulation scenarios that converge rapidly to the optimal solution, and allows the NDT to timely perform the adaptation. The contribution of this article is threefold. It provides (i) the first systematic analysis of the differences and potential synergies between NDT and NS; (ii) a synthetic presentation of the integration of NS and associated decision algorithms within a NDT to unlock NS accessibility and credibility throughout the life cycle of an IoT solution; (iii) a proposal for a smart and cost-efficient integration of NS in NDT via surrogate modeling, for reducing evaluation and optimization cost, paving the way to NS-augmented NDT-based dynamic adaptation and real-time optimization of IoT networks.',\n",

Relying on more efficient machine learning algorithms to get a reasonable prediction of credit risk can reduce the self-generated losses of the Internet of Things finance and increase profits. This article uses distributed search engine technology to customize web crawlers to obtain the required bank card and transaction data from the multi-source heterogeneous data of the Internet of Things financial industry, design the corresponding Spark parallel algorithm to preprocess the data, and establish an inverted table and two Level index file provides data source for big data analysis platform. After the data source is determined, the Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) analysis method is combined with the scores of many financial business experts in the industry to obtain a set of candidate indicators and quantification methods for the financial credit risk evaluation of the Internet of Things, and analyze the correlation of indicators and risk grading. The random forest algorithm in the big data machine learning library is used to select the feature of the candidate index set, and a multi-level spatial association rule algorithm based on the Hash structure is designed to mine the financial risk information of the Internet of Things, and build a credit risk assessment and intelligent early warning model. This paper selects 26 indicators of Internet of Things finance as the research objects, uses SPSS26.0 software to perform sample Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett sphere test on the original data, and describes the results of factor analysis in detail. The particle swarm algorithm is introduced into the parameter optimization of random forest, and the financial credit risk assessment model of the Internet of Things is established. The results show that this method can significantly reduce the probability of banks making the first and second error rates when evaluating the credit risk of financing the Internet of Things Finance. This is conducive to the smooth development of the Internet of Things financial business for banks, which enables banks to enhance their own profitability while effectively reducing losses due to incorrect credit provision.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The growing reliance of industry 4.0/5.0 on emergent technologies has dramatically increased the scope of cyber threats and data privacy issues. Recently, federated learning (FL) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) promote the detection of large-scale cyber-attacks in resource-constrained and heterogeneous industrial systems without exposing data to privacy issues. However, the inherent characteristics of the latter have led to problems such as a trusted validation and consensus of the federation, unreliability, and privacy protection of model upload. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving secure framework, named PPSS, based on the use of blockchain-enabled FL with improved privacy, verifiability, and transparency. The PPSS framework adopts the permissioned-blockchain system to secure multi-party computation as well as to incentivize cross-silo FL based on a lightweight and energy-efficient consensus protocol named Proof-of-Federated Deep-Learning (PoFDL). Specifically, we design two federated stages for global model aggregation. The first stage uses differentially private training of Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) to enforce privacy protection of client updates, while the second stage uses PoFDL protocol to prove and add new model-containing blocks to the blockchain. We study the performance of the proposed PPSS framework using a new cyber security dataset (Edge-IIoT dataset) in terms of detection rate, precision, accuracy, computation, and energy cost. The results demonstrate that the PPSS framework system can detect industrial IIoT attacks with high classification performance under two distribution modes, namely, non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) and independent and identically distributed (IID).',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Efficient utilization and implementation of artificial intelligence (IA) can influence human life in managing their usefulness. Researchers and domain experts are pondering that in the long run, the influences and repercussions of AI. It can be invaluable and add value in an individual life to a large extent, and at the same time, it may limit human free will. Researchers are contemplating that by next decade, the AI system used by corporations is likely to execute ethnic decision-making and will help in developing Society 5.0. It can be associated with monetary growth in determining societal development in achieving better quality of life that people can enjoy in developing the society. The need for efficient utilization of AI in ethnic decision will entertain numerous requirements of individuals irrespective of language, age, sex, or the regions. The key utilization of AI in developing Society 5.0 was initially taken by a Japanese cabinet decision during the fifth Science and Technology summit, with an aim of financial regeneration through investments for tomorrow and maintaining sustainable growth policy in comprehending Society 5.0. Based on the Japanese plan, the purpose is to achieve enduring growth through incorporating the Industrial Revolution 4.0 paradigm by integrating technologies such as Big Data, IoT, robotics match, and mix of AI features. Mainly five strategic choices were proposed for Society 5.0, namely, healthy life and enhanced life expectancy, attainment of mobility solution, development of futuristic value chain, smart infrastructure, smart cities, and model town. Society 5.0 was initially announced by Japan and likely to follow the suit for the rest of the globe. The explainable AI and society 5.0, should not be confined only to Japan but should be spread to all those striving to sustain the development of society for the coming decades. However, Japan is facing some limitations and challenges such as aging masses, poor infrastructure growth, dwindling birth rate that led to overall decline in population, and so on. Japan can participate in promoting Society 5.0 by taking first steps and reaping the advantage of being first mover in establishing sustainable development. It can integrate the variety of systems by encouraging and supporting society in implementing digital revolution. The principal aim of conceptualization of Society 5.0 is to incorporate technologies such as AI, Big Data, IoT, IIoT, Cloud Computing, and so on.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Computer networks are dealing with growing complexity, given the ever-increasing volume of data produced by all sorts of network nodes. Performance improvements are a non-stop ambition and require tuning fine-grained details of the system operation. Analyzing such data deluge, however, is not straightforward and sometimes not supported by the system. There are often problems regarding scalability and the predisposition of the involved nodes to understand and transfer the data. This issue is at least partially circumvented by knowledge acquisition from past experiences, which is a characteristic of the herein called “challenged networks”. The addition of intelligence in these scenarios is fundamental to extract linear and non-linear relationships from the data collected by multiple sources. This is undoubtedly an invitation to machine learning and, more particularly, to deep learning. This paper identifies five different challenged networks: IoT and sensor, mobile, industrial, and vehicular networks as typical scenarios that may have multiple and heterogeneous data sources and face obstacles concerning connectivity. As a consequence, deep learning solutions can contribute to system performance by adding intelligence and the ability to interpret data. We start the paper by providing an overview of deep learning, further explaining this approach’s benefits over the cited scenarios. We propose a workflow based on our observations of deep learning applications over challenged networks, and based on it, we strive to survey the literature on deep-learning-based solutions at an application-oriented level using the PRISMA methodology. Afterward, we also discuss new deep learning techniques that show enormous potential for further improvements as well as transversal issues, such as security. Finally, we provide lessons learned raising trends linking all surveyed papers to deep learning approaches. We are confident that the proposed paper contributes to the state of the art and can be a piece of inspiration for beginners and also for enthusiasts on advanced networking research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices brings countless benefits, but it also brings new security and forensics challenges. The IoT system with billions of devices generates a huge amount of evidence which causes big challenges to digital investigators and practitioners who are required to interact with IoT devices to investigate cybercrimes in a forensically sound and timely fashion. These challenges create more opportunities for cybercrimes to attack various IoT application and services resulting in a direct impact on IoT users. As the IoT has incorporated in most aspects of our life, cybercrimes will literally threaten human life, hence, IoT forensics is required to investigate and mitigate against such attacks. Therefore, this paper provides a detailed review of IoT forensics. It started by providing a comprehensive discussion of IoT security involving the need for security by design and security challenges of the IoT system. Then, a review of IoT forensics is presented by highlighting the need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IoT forensics, state-of-the-art research and recent studies, opportunities and key requirements for a successful IoT forensics. Challenges and suggested solutions of IoT forensics are also discussed. Finally, a discussion of open research directions of IoT forensics is presented.',\n",

Dynamic modeling based on machine learning methods, e.g., intelligent time series prediction modeling, is a popular and suitable way to solve the above issue. In this article, a systematic literature review on applying advanced time series models has been systematically conducted via a detailed analysis and evaluation of 61 pieces selected from 221 articles. The historical process of time series model application from the use of data and information strategies was first discussed. Subsequently, the accuracy and generalization of the model from the selection of model parameters and time steps, providing a new perspective for model development in this field, were compared and analyzed. Finally, the systematic review results demonstrate that, compared with traditional models, deep neural networks could increase data structure mining capabilities and overall information simulation capabilities through innovative and effective structures, thereby it could also broaden the selection range of environmental parameters for agricultural facilities and achieve environmental prediction end-to-end optimization via intelligent time series model based on deep neural networks.',\n",

This paper presents a review of the specialised literature on LiDAR systems applied to precision agriculture; specifically, in cultivating crops. First, some preliminaries of LiDAR systems according to the mode of transport used, considering terrestrial, mobile, and aerial laser scanners, are given. Subsequently, a well-organised taxonomy of recent LiDAR applications based on the activity being performed is presented. Here, the following four categories are considered: (1) crop-related metric estimation, (2) tree and plant digitisation, (3) vision systems for object detection and navigation, and (4) planning and decision support. Lastly, we discuss some current trends and research challenges in applying LiDAR technology to cultivation activities in accordance with the state-of-the-art literature.',\n",

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is becoming more common in IoT implying a growing need for security and authentication. Current advancements in IoT indicate fundamental changes in global communication infrastructures. Many facets of urban lives in smart cities are significantly impacted by increased interoperability of smart communication technologies. This paper proposes an IoT network-based threat mitigation strategy based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm. Using pre-processed and feature-extracted data, RNN seeks to categorise attributes associated with attacks. XBoost model selects features after the datasets have been preprocessed using min-max scaling technique. The simulations are executed over KDD datasets and assessed for the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure. The findings of this work demonstrated that in both training and testing datasets, the proposed RNN based schema achieves high degrees of classification accuracy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Climate change and population growth are triggering a digital transformation in agriculture. Consequently, agri-food supply chains are becoming more intelligent, producing vast amounts of data and pushing the boundaries of the traditional food lifecycle. However, artificial intelligence (AI) for the extended agri-food supply chain is only beginning to emerge. This paper presents a short literature review of eighteen papers on the intelligent agri-food supply chain. The bibliometric analysis reveals key research clusters and current trends in the AI-enabled stages of food production, distribution, and sustainable consumption. The important advances of AI in traditional stages of production need to be expanded with intelligent planning for demand uncertainty and personalized needs of end-customers, storage optimization, waste reduction in the post-production phase (e.g., distribution and recycling), and boundary-spanning analytics. For theory, this work highlights mature areas for AI adoption in agri-food and identifies opportunities for future research in the extended agri-food supply chain. For practice, the review findings can inspire startups interested in extended agri-food ecosystems and incumbents in their pilot projects for the intelligent and sustainable digital transformation of agri-food.

       "  'abstract': 'In recent decades, most internet-connected devices were personal computers. However, everything is connecting to the Internet over time. Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding rapidly, including everything from clothing to agricultural equipment. The Internet of Everything (IoE) is very complex and heterogeneous due to the independent development of its various sections. Hence, the coordination and management of its different equipment are challenging, and the energy consumption efficiency is very low, which is the bottleneck of battery-operated IoT equipment. So far, various methods have been proposed to reduce energy consumption in IoT devices. However, these methods are used independently and individually on a single IoT node, and none of them consider all objects in the IoT hierarchy together. Whereas the IoT network arises when various objects interact with each other. Therefore, focusing on energy consumption in a single node should be transformed into energy management at the whole network administrative level. In this paper, considering the IoT network features and the data exchange all over the network, a data manipulation method is proposed to reduce energy consumption and network traffic by decreasing the amount of data exchanged. Furthermore, we take advantage of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enhance the efficiency of this method by adapting our energy management decisions to the environmental conditions’ dynamicity. Simulation results using real data workloads demonstrate that the proposed method decreases energy consumption by up to 38.1\\\\% without an SDN. This reduction is significantly improved by up to 80.0\\\\% when utilizing SDN. We also experimentally evaluate the proposed method by its hardware implementation in the real environment and illustrate that a maximum of only 1.3\\\\% difference is observed between the simulation results and the experiments, which indicates the consistency of the results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining demanding growth in the field of smart cities, agriculture, food management, and weather forecasting due to the lack of computing power on sensing devices. The applications of artificial intelligence are integrated with various Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous sensors for the improvement of the agriculture sector and to decrease its management cost. Due to the bounded resources of wireless technologies, most of the solutions are designed for efficient delivery of agriculture data to cloud systems, however, still optimizing the resources management and data load for forwarding nodes, especially those closest to edge boundaries is a challenging issue. Moreover, due to the collection of incorrect environmental data, the decision-making process leads to a decrease in the productivity of the optimization process. To overcome such issues, this work proposes a trustworthy and intelligent agricultural model that uses metaheuristic optimization to enhance resource management to address these problems. The proposed model approach employs the decision-making function to overcome information loss and inconsistency. Moreover, it builds trust in agricultural data collection by using secure IoT devices and facilitating reliable communication. In terms of performance metrics, the proposed model is simulated to assess its importance in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions. It not only collects updated data from agricultural land but also uses artificial intelligence's lightweight optimization technique to reduce the overheads on IoT devices. The experiment findings demonstrate the importance of the proposed model for resource monitoring and overheads on the IoT system.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Water is the most limiting natural resource in many semi-arid areas. This, together with the current climate change scenario, is fostering a context of uncertainty and major challenges concerning the sustainability and viability of existing agroecosystems. Crop water status based on three pre-established values (severe, mild, and no stress) is the essential datum needed to implement optimised irrigation scheduling based on deficit irrigation. Currently however, its calculation is a repetitive, tedious, and technical process carried out by hand. This communication presents a novel system based on continuous measurements of leaf turgor pressure to assess the crop water status when deficit irrigation strategies are being applied and/or to optimise irrigation scheduling in water scarcity scenarios. To this end, a novel expert system based on machine learning, together with an IoT infrastructure based on continuous measurements of leaf turgor pressure, is able to predict the citrus crop ψstem with a 99\\\\% F1 score. Thus, crop irrigation strategies involving irrigation-restriction cycles can be applied based on stem water potential.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) symbolizes numerous devices which are connected globally through the internet technology and are able to collect and share relevant data. The IoT has thus achieved a significant advancement in the field of sensors, networks, and communication technologies, such as long-term evolution (LTE) technology, fifth generation (5G) technology, wireless sensor networks (WSN), and others. Apart from technological advancements, the ability of IoT to run fully embedded (with or without an operating system), gather real-time data, estimate physical parameters, facilitate decision making based on the data gathered, use of various networks (e.g., local area networks (LAN), low-power wide-area network (LPWAN), cellular LPWAN) has provided enormous opportunities for its applications in the railway industry and other domains. The current study performs a comprehensive holistic survey of various IoT technologies that can be used in railway operations, management, maintenance, video surveillance, and safety at level crossings. This study also discusses current trends in the IoT, emerging IoT technologies, green IoT applications, and various research studies that have been conducted in the areas related to railway applications. Furthermore, various challenges that are associated with the IoT applications are discussed along with potential efforts that can be made to overcome these challenges. The outcomes of this work are expected to offer important insights regarding the applicability of IoT technologies for sustainable railway transportation, their future potential, operational benefits to relevant stakeholders and authorities, as well as critical future research needs that have to be addressed in the following years.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The abrupt rise in extreme weather events (floods, heat waves, droughts, etc.) due to changing climate in the last decades has increased the level of threats to various sectors (agriculture, energy, transportation, etc.) globally. The climate projections from global circulation models indicate even more intense and frequent extreme events in the future, which in turn pose more risks to socioeconomic infrastructure. The enhanced understanding of the climate-related financial risk associated with businesses has driven efforts to include critical information on probable risks associated with climate change in financial decision-making. In this study, we have presented a framework to assess the need of incorporating climate risk assessment as an integral part of business operations. We also reviewed revealed literature to understand the possible impacts of climate change on various sectors and presented key strategies to assess the climate risk associated with them. Also, a framework incorporating probable climate threats to business ecology with principles of robustness, resourcefulness, redundancy, and rapidity has been proposed to adapt and mitigate associated risks for a climate-resilient business ecosystem. The integration of Artificial Intelligence in managing risk could be a promising tool for enhancing business resilience to climate change and could be used as a tool. Robust and accurate predictions of climate and weather extremes from deep learning algorithms at a significant lead time can help in minimizing the associated risk with a business infrastructure. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs), a weather extreme cause huge socioeconomic risk by triggering floods and droughts in various continents of mid-latitude regions. We have presented a case study investigating the ability of deep learning algorithms to predict ARs. The results from the analysis advocate the application of deep learning algorithms to predict weather and climate extremes in decision support systems to enhance the climate resilience of a business ecosystem.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the environment is the subject of discourse, with arguments for both positive and negative effects. There is a fine line between AI for good and AI for environmental degradation. Today, companies want to seize the benefits of AI, which distinctively involves reducing the company's carbon footprint. However, AI's carbon emissions differ as per the techniques involved in training it. As the saying goes, a coin always has two sides. Therefore, it cannot be denied that AI can be an effective tool for combating climate change, but its role in contributing to carbon emissions cannot be ignored. Multiple studies indicate that AI could be the game-changer in staving off anthropogenic climatic changes due to the deterioration of the environment and global warming. This double-edged relationship and interdependency of AI and carbon emissions are represented through a system of systems (SoS) approach. SoS states that a plan is created through multiple smaller systems, creating complexity in the design and vice versa. A complex system can be assumed as the world in general, where two individual independent systems AI and carbon emissions, when in interaction, create a complex complementary and contradictory relation, adding to the convolution of the system. This connection is demonstrated by conducting a network analysis and calculating the carbon emissions of six machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning (DL) models with different datasets but the same hyperparameters on a carbon emission calculator created through AI algorithms. The primary idea of this study is to encourage the AI society to create efficient AI models that may be used without compromising environmental issues. The focus should be on practicing sustainable AI, that is, sustainability from data collection to model deployment, throughout the lifecycle of AI.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary technique of sharing data for smart devices that generates huge amounts of data from smart healthcare systems. Therefore, healthcare systems utilize the convergence power and traffic analysis of sensors that cannot be satisfactorily handled by the IoT. In this article, a novel mutation operator is devised and incorporated with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Two tests have been conducted in the validation process. Firstly, the newly dual adaption-based operators incorporated with the differential evolution algorithm are being proposed. The proposed approach provides sufficient diversity and enhances the search speed of nature’s local and global search environments in the problem. The proposed method incorporates the application of IoT-based smart healthcare. Second, an application-based test has been conducted, in which the proposed approach is applied to the application in the smart healthcare system. Therefore, IoT sensor deployment is an optimization problem to minimize service time, delay, and energy loss by considering the communication constraint between sensors(objects). The proposed algorithm is applied in this article to solve this optimization problem. Further, in the experimentation and comparative study, the proposed method is superior to the standard evolutionary algorithms in IoT applications concerning the minimum number of function evaluations and minimization of traffic services. The proposed approach also achieves efficiency in the minimum loss of energy in each service and reduces load and delay.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modernization and technological advancement have made smart and convenient living environments, including smart houses and smart cities, possible, by combining the Internet of Things (IoT), data, and internet-based services over various communication protocols. IoT is the next generation of the Internet. However, commonly resource-constraint IoT devices that are designed to perform a specific purpose, impose new security challenges, including node forgery, unauthorized access of data, and denial of services. They are more susceptible to being compromised by adversaries as opposed to general-purpose computing devices, and are exposed to different kinds of attacks, including spoofing and botnet attacks. Device identification is one of the promising approaches for improving network security. Devices can be identified either using explicit identifiers (internet protocol/media access control addresses) or implicit identifiers (network traffic and radio signal features), with implicit identifiers being more reliable, robust, and secure for device fingerprinting (DFP). In this paper, DFP methods have been studied in detail, with features generated from their communication traffic characteristics, including network traffic traces, IEEE 802.11 MAC frames, and radio signals, discussed. Additionally, key limitations and research challenges have been studied in the context of the IoT paradigm. Research challenges within the context of DFP and the future of IoT technologies are also discussed to shape future directions of work in the area. The key contribution of this study is the identification of different DFP research scopes in the domain of the IoT paradigm, which can be designed and implemented toward the development of IoT network security.',\n",

Recent technology, like the Internet of Things (IoT), demonstrates an impressive performance in fast-forward development. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used as a lifeline to prevent attacks by classifying the activities as normal and suspicious. In this paper, we propose a two-phase IDS for IoT. In the first phase, we categorize data into four sections according to the data types (i.e., nominal, integer, binary, and float). We then classify them using different versions of the Naive Bayes classifier. After that, we use majority voting to choose the final result of the classification. In the second phase, we pass those data which behave normally or are benign in the first phase and classify them using an unsupervised elliptic envelope. We validated our work using the standard NSL-KDD, UNSW\\\\_NB15, and CIC-IDS2017 datasets. We found the proposed method more efficient than existing IDS techniques and achieved reasonable accuracy in the first phase. Furthermore, the benign data is sent to the second phase of the analysis. After the second phase, we achieved a 97\\\\% accuracy in the NSL-KDD dataset, 86.9\\\\% in the UNSW\\\\_NB15 dataset, and 98.59\\\\% accuracy in the CIC-IDS2017 dataset.',\n",

While it creates employment opportunities and offers food security for the entire nation, the lack of infrastructure and resources might be limiting its potential to thrive further. One of the aspects addressed in this paper is low yield production. With the aid of a sensor-based irrigation model, data is collected and analyzed in the cloud to enable real-time monitoring. It is then integrated with an Android application for displaying results in an user-friendly interface. Through the application, farmers can control the farm manually, or with a timer in minutes. The Machine Learning model predicts the suitable crops, in accordance with varying weather parameters. The application has a classified portal for farmers and customers to buy/sell directly, eliminating any involvement of mediators. One of the novelties in this research includes monitoring/controlling farm equipment and predicting field crops from a locally installed LCD display and keypad present in farmer's respective homes. The proposed work aims to create an energy-efficient, user-friendly framework for the agricultural workforce, yielding better crop production, improving farmers' living standards, and contributing effectively to the nation's economic growth. The prototype shows a reduction of water usage in fields by more than 60\\\\%.

       "  'abstract': \"Weed detection has become an integral part of precision farming that leverages the IoT framework. Weeds have become responsible for 45\\\\% of the agriculture industry's crop losses due mainly to the competition with crops. An efficient weed detection method can reduce this percentage. This paper proposes a vision-based weed detection system using deep learning models that effectively detect weed within a soybean plantation. Five deep learning models are used, including MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and three custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Models. The MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 were deployed on a Raspberry PI controller for comparison purposes. Based on a dataset with 400 images and 1536 total segments, the custom 5-layer CNN architecture shows high detection accuracy of 97.7\\\\% and the lowest latency \\\\& memory usage with 1.78 GB and 22.245 ms respectively. Utilizing the proposed custom deep learning CNN model with high accuracy can positively impact efficiency, time, and overall production within the soybean industry.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'For the past decade, there has been a significant increase in customer usage of public transport applications in smart cities. These applications rely on various services, such as communication and computation, provided by additional nodes within the smart city environment. However, these services are delivered by a diverse range of cloud computing-based servers that are widely spread and heterogeneous, leading to cybersecurity becoming a crucial challenge among these servers. Numerous machine-learning approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the cybersecurity challenges in heterogeneous transport applications within smart cities. However, the centralized security and scheduling strategies suggested so far have yet to produce optimal results for transport applications. This work aims to present a secure decentralized infrastructure for transporting data in fog cloud networks. This paper introduces Multi-Objectives Reinforcement Federated Learning Blockchain (MORFLB) for Transport Infrastructure. MORFLB aims to minimize processing and transfer delays while maximizing long-term rewards by identifying known and unknown attacks on remote sensing data in-vehicle applications. MORFLB incorporates multi-agent policies, proof-of-work hashing validation, and decentralized deep neural network training to achieve minimal processing and transfer delays. It comprises vehicle applications, decentralized fog, and cloud nodes based on blockchain reinforcement federated learning, which improves rewards through trial and error. The study formulates a combinatorial problem that minimizes and maximizes various factors for vehicle applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MORFLB effectively reduces processing and transfer delays while maximizing rewards compared to existing studies. It provides a promising solution to address the cybersecurity challenges in intelligent transport applications within smart cities. In conclusion, this paper presents MORFLB, a combination of different schemes that ensure the execution of transport data under their constraints and achieve optimal results with the suggested decentralized infrastructure based on blockchain technology.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Cotton is known as ‘white gold’ in the agricultural industry. Agriculture is the primary source of economic income in Bangladesh and the country's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture. The soil and water resources of our country are fertile and the climate is moderate. But numerous diseases affect crop production and cause enormous crop losses, endangering the lives of helpless farmers. A previous report showed that about 70–80\\\\% of cotton diseases were leaf diseases and 30–20\\\\% were pest diseases. Experts typically use bare eyes to find and identify such plant diseases and pests which may result from lower accuracy of the identification. As a result, early detection of cotton disease using AI-based systems may help to increase the production of cotton by detecting the leaf disease significantly. In this research, we proposed a DL-based cotton leaf disease detection approach using fine-tuning Transfer Learning (TL) algorithms by tuning the layers and parameters of the existing TL algorithms. We also investigated the performance of several fine-tuning TL models such as VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3 and Xception on the publicly available cotton dataset for cotton disease prediction. The investigations found that the Xception model provides the highest accuracy rate of 98.70\\\\% and was selected to develop a web-based smart application for real-life cotton disease prediction in farming to increase cotton production. Hence, our model can accurately diagnose cotton leaf diseases and will provide a new window for the automatic leaf disease diagnosis of other plants.\",\n",

This paper presents a review of existing analytics algorithms deployed on IoT-enabled edge cloud infrastructure that resolved the challenges of data outliers, data redundancies, and cloud resource load balancing. The review highlights the problems solved, the results, the weaknesses of the existing algorithms, and the physical and virtual cloud storage servers for resource load balancing. In addition, it discusses the adoption of network protocols that govern the interaction between the three-layer architecture of IoT sensing devices enabled edge cloud and its prevailing challenges. A total of 72 algorithms covering the categories of classification, regression, clustering, deep learning, and optimization have been reviewed. The classification approach has been widely adopted to solve the problem of redundant data, while clustering and optimization approaches are more used for outlier detection and cloud resource allocation.',\n",

This paradigm shift catalyzes the widespread adoption of autonomous decision-making systems, particularly in sectors like agriculture, where the aim is to amplify productivity. As a result of the agricultural domain, mushrooms have concurrently emerged as a significant component of daily diets, offering additional vitamins and flavor. Despite their popularity, cultivating mushrooms in open environments poses challenges in maintaining optimal environmental conditions, prompting numerous research efforts. Recognizing the inconsistencies in existing approaches to safeguard vital parameters in mushroom farms, this paper introduces an innovative system utilizing intelligent sensors whose real-time records are managed based on the fuzzy sets concept. These sensors, encompassing the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2, DHT22 Sensor, Light Dependent Resistor (LDR sensor), and Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR sensor), collectively capture essential data for decision-making in mushroom farming. Employing fuzzy logic, the system addresses pivotal aspects such as substrate watering, environmental control, light management, and pest detection. Through experimental results, it becomes evident that the proposed system not only exemplifies the potential of IoT technologies in agriculture but also offers a comprehensive and efficient approach to real-time decision-making. By aggregating sensor data, the system proves instrumental in enhancing the quality and yield of mushroom crops, showcasing a promising trajectory for sustainable and technologically driven agricultural practices.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution offers significant opportunities to capitalise on the growth of digitalisation and has the potential to enable the ‘system of systems’ approach required in increasingly complex infrastructure systems. This paper reviews the extent to which research in economic infrastructure sectors has engaged with fields of AI, to investigate the specific AI methods chosen and the purposes to which they have been applied both within and across sectors. Machine learning is found to dominate the research in this field, with methods such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests among the most popular. The automated reasoning technique of fuzzy logic has also seen widespread use, due to its ability to incorporate uncertainties in input variables. Across the infrastructure sectors of energy, water and wastewater, transport, and telecommunications, the main purposes to which AI has been applied are network provision, forecasting, routing, maintenance and security, and network quality management. The data-driven nature of AI offers significant flexibility, and work has been conducted across a range of network sizes and at different temporal and geographic scales. However, there remains a lack of integration of planning and policy concerns, such as stakeholder engagement and quantitative feasibility assessment, and the majority of research focuses on a specific type of infrastructure, with an absence of work beyond individual economic sectors. To enable solutions to be implemented into real-world infrastructure systems, research will need to move away from a siloed perspective and adopt a more interdisciplinary perspective that considers the increasing interconnectedness of these systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent times, due to the growing global population and increased food demand, smart agriculture is becoming more vital. In this context, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have emerged as a significant pathway to innovative agricultural techniques. Due to their low capacity, these IoT nodes have faced energy limits and complicated routing methods. As a result, in the sphere of IoT-based agriculture, transmitting data failure, energy consumption, network lifetime reduction, and delay occur. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a novel combination of optimized intelligent smart irrigation systems to improve the energy management performance of the system. Here, the optimal cluster head formation and selection is performed by Hierarchy Shuffled Shepherd Clustering (HSSC) method. Also, the finest energy regulation and routing path are provided by the proposed Emperor Penguin Jellyfish Optimizer (EPJO) method. The simulation of this work is performed on Network Simulator-2 (NS2) software. The simulation consequences from the proposed method are validated and compared with the conventional methods. Thus, the proposed approach results demonstrate that the developed model has much lesser energy consumption and improved network lifetime as compared to the traditional works.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Due to low labor participation by young adults and an aging agricultural population, Taiwan and the rest of the world are facing labor shortages in agriculture, which will affect aquaculture production. The proposed system is intended primarily for solving the problems faced by the aquaculture farming sector in Taiwan by designing a smart IoT-based fish monitoring and control system equipped with different IoT devices to enable real-time data collection; so that fishpond water-quality conditions and other system parameters can be readily monitored, adjusted, and assessed remotely. To predict the growth of the California Bass fish, this study also develops a deep learning model (DL) that correlates the different parameters of the smart aquaculture system. Bayesian optimization-based hyper-parameter tuning was employed to find the optimal DL model configuration to produce accurate predictions on the given experimental data set. The optimal model produces an R2 value of 0.94 and a mean square error of 0.0015, demonstrating the applicability of the model to predict the desired output. Based on the results of the experiments, the DL model can be incorporated into the autonomous feeding system, reducing the amount of leftover feed. Thus, aquaculture based on the artificial intelligence of things (AIOT) can assist fish farmers in intelligently controlling and managing different fishpond equipment remotely and assist aquaculture operators in performing professional aquaculture, lowering the industry's entry barrier, and promoting aquaculture.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agricultural pests cause between 20 and 40 percent loss of global crop production every year as reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Therefore, smart agriculture presents the best option for farmers to apply artificial intelligence techniques integrated with modern information and communication technology to eliminate these harmful insect pests. Consequently, the productivity of their crops can be increased. Hence, this article introduces a new mobile application to automatically classify pests using a deep-learning solution for supporting specialists and farmers. The developed application utilizes faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) to accomplish the recognition task of insect pests based on cloud computing. Furthermore, a database of recommended pesticides is linked with the detected crop pests to guide the farmers. This study has been successfully validated on five groups of pests; called Aphids, Cicadellidae, Flax Budworm, Flea Beetles, and Red Spider. The proposed Faster R-CNN showed highest accurate recognition results of 99.0\\\\% for all tested pest images. Moreover, our deep learning method outperforms other previous recognition methods, i.e., Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD) MobileNet and traditional back propagation (BP) neural networks. The main prospect of this study is to realize our developed application for on-line recognition of agricultural pests in both the open field such as large farms and greenhouses for specific crops.',\n",

It is necessary to resolve the contradiction between increasing yields and preserving the environment. In this sense, modern technological solutions in agriculture should be applied, which will lead to an increase in productivity, i.e. creating a higher yield on the same or smaller areas. This can be achieved by optimizing the use of inputs in agriculture by introducing different solutions within precision agriculture. AI is one solution that needs to be developed and that leads to sustainable development. Adequate education, digital literacy and appropriate infrastructure are also required for its application. The goal of the research is to indicate the direction in which technological progress in agriculture should go and how the current technologies applied in agriculture reflect on the economic and sustainable development.

Thus, a sensor is turned on only when a change in monitored phenomenon value exceeds a predefined threshold. Two algorithms are analyzed, namely statistical and machine learning. DMF shows notable performance, resulting either with up to ∼70\\\\% less missed readings, or it collects up to ∼40\\\\% less data compared to the baseline algorithm that collects data with static monitoring frequency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Since the dawn of agriculture, farmers have been at the stake of dealing with pests and diseases. Chemical pesticides are a reliable source of controlling pests and pathogens, but indiscriminate use of pesticides can cause severe consequences for human health and the ecosystem. Therefore, sustainable crop production is to be followed where pests and pathogens infestation should be detected at the very initial stage of infection so that judicious management practices could be undertaken. Initial detection of pests and pathogens in standing crops is a big challenge. Many approaches, such as traditional visual and molecular detection, are used to detect pathogens invasively at a very small scale in the field and require laboratory facilities. However, the recent advancement of remote sensing and image analysis-based technologies have been used to detect the occurrence of pests and pathogens precisely in vast areas, in real-time, and in a non-invasive way. This paper discussed the latest achievements in monitoring pests and diseases using remote sensing technologies coupled with image processing and spectroscopy-based methods. We also discussed the opportunities and challenges of P\\\\&D monitoring using these technologies. Despite many challenges, these cutting-edge technologies could be used to ensure sustainable and safe crop production by avoiding the excessive yet expensive and harmful use of pesticides in crop protection and ensuring precision agriculture.',\n",

But due to some limitations of security, privacy, etc. it is not possible to use IoT devices in the field of agriculture at its fullest. To overcome these limitations Blockchain is used as it provides security, privacy and it helps in monitoring, examining, to authenticate the agriculture data. With the help of Blockchain, traditional methods of collection, rearranging and distribution of Agri-products can be replaced by more trust-worthy, decentralized, vitreous, and immutable style. In agriculture sector, Blockchain and Internet of things can be amalgamated to have better results which leads us to one level up in the field of agriculture and may control or improve the supply chain in proper manner. The consequences of using blockchain and IoT in combination will result in better understanding to supervise and managing the agriculture effectively. This chapter will illustrate the importance of using blockchain and IoT collectively to develop smart agriculture from traditional agriculture. A model is also proposed to overcome the challenges encountered in agriculture sector, based on IoT applications with the help of blockchain. Also, a review is mentioned about the main characteristics and functions of blockchain used in agriculture sector such as livestock grazing, crops and food supply chain.

       "  'abstract': 'Internet of Things (IoT) was employed for monitoring the growth parameters of rocket (Eruca sativa) plants cultivated in a greenhouse under supplemental LEDs lighting. Red (R), blue (B) and the combination red and blue in different ratios (75R:25B, 50R:50B, 25R:75B), were employed, as well as white LEDs. The LED lamps were automatically turned on at 18:00 and off at 24:00. Thus, the plants were grown in an 18 h photoperiod until the harvest time under daylight supplementary lighting (i.e. 12 h sunlight and 6 h LED). Yield, biomass, leaf area (LA), leaf area index (LAI), leaf area rate (LAR), leaf weight rate (LWR), specific leaf area (SLA), relative growth rate (RGR), crop growth rate (CGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) of rocket plants were investigated, through sensors of temperature, humidity and light intensity via a Raspberry Pi board by the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communication protocol. ANOVA results demonstrated that 50R:50B LEDs lighting produce higher yield, total biomass, LA, CGR, LAI, LWR, as well as lower SLA as compared to other treatments. Reliability analysis showed that IoT monitoring system is stable and reliable for controlling of environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, humidity) of the greenhouse.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In the current scenario, TCP/IP is widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT) for disseminating data, addressing, and controlling traffic. However, the exponential growth of IoT devices has incurred the TCP/IP-based network from mismanagement due to heavy traffic, address space scarcity, and low efficiency. In the last few years, Information-centric networking (ICN) has emerged as an excellent choice to address the above issues. One of the important characteristics of ICN is In-network Caching, in which contents are cached at the intermediate nodes. Most in-network caching strategies use traditional replacement policies such as First in first out, least recently used, and least frequently used, ignoring the essential content properties, eventually evicting the vital contents. This work introduces a novel content replacement scheme that proactively records the number of requests and access time of the content in the Pending interest table (PIT) and considers essential content attributes, e.g., number of requests, remaining lifetime, and upcoming request waiting time, before replacement to retain vital contents in the cache. The simulations are performed on the ndnSIM framework of NS-3 to evaluate the performance of our proposed replacement scheme with other widely used benchmark replacement schemes and tested under six different caching strategies. The experimental finding indicates that, on average, the proposed replacement scheme shows 28.94\\\\% and 27.49\\\\% increase in cache hit ratio and server hit reduction ratio while 22.30\\\\% and 30.64\\\\% reduction in response delay and energy consumption compared to NDN-FIFO, NDN-LRU, and NDN-LRFU.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In industrial business-to-business (B2B) markets, physical entities (such as products, machines, materials, or other objects) are increasingly connected among each other. This Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is quickly developing thanks to advances in fields such as information systems, factory digitalization, data sciences, robotics. Thus, industrial markets appear both as business networks - encompassing connections between individual or organizational actors – and networks of connected things. The purpose of this research is to provide an integrative perspective that encompasses both types of networks. It seeks to contribute to the literature on industrial B2B markets in two ways. First, it proposes the system of systems (SoS) theory - which emphasizes diversity and autonomy of systems - as an integrative perspective. Second, it argues that this integrated perspective contributes to a new view on how resources are produced, combined, and used, and, therefore, on business network models. We discuss the implications for one of the most established models, the IMP Group's A-R-A model.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to enable objects to sense, identify, and analyze the world, but to achieve such goal cost-effectively, it should involve low-cost solutions. That implies a series of limitations, such as small battery life, limited storage capabilities, low accuracy, and imprecise sensors. Data fusion is one of the most widely used methods for improving sensor accuracy and providing a more precise decision. Therefore, we propose Hydra, a multilevel data fusion architecture, to improve sensor accuracy, identify application target events, and make more accurate decisions. Hydra is composed of three layers: low-level (sensor data fusion), medium-level (events and decision making), and high-level (decision fusion based on multiple applications). In partnership with Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), we instantiated Hydra for the smart agriculture domain, and we also developed two applications aiming smart water management. The first application goal was to determine the need for irrigation based on soil moisture levels, and the second ascertained the adequate irrigation time by estimating the crop’s evapotranspiration (rate of water evaporation by the soil and transpiration by plants). We performed a set of experiments to assess Hydra: (i) evaluation of methods to detect and remove outliers; (ii) analyze data resulting from the applications; (iii) the use of machine learning to create a new accurate evapotranspiration model based on the sensors data. The results indicate that a combination of the ESD method (Extreme Studentized Deviate) and WRKF filter (Weighted Outlier-Robust Kalman Filter) was the best method to identify and remove outliers. Moreover, we generated an evapotranspiration model using the SVM (Support Machine Vector) quadratic machine-learning model that produced values close to the evapotranspiration reference model (Penman-Monteith).',\n",

Currently, the agricultural industry is the world’s largest water user and consumes about 70\\\\% of the water in different processes. In this food and environmental crisis, the new methods for growing plants in the agricultural domain are various; one of these methods is aquaponics which is a sustainable agriculture system that combines two names: Aquaculture, which is the farming of fish and Hydroponic which is the cultivation of plants (Off-soil) using water enriched with mineral materials. Aquaponics comes as a solution to enhance farming and agriculture productivity. The attention towards the aquaponics system is increasing due to its high efficiency, availability, and fewer resources consumption. However, there is intensive automation, monitoring, and control requirement for a smart aquaponics system. To enhance the productivity of aquaponics, it is required to utilize IoT-based technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The main aim of this paper at hand consists of proposing a new contribution based on the Internet of Things (IoT) solution that could control and monitor water quality and environmental parameters by using the maximum of sensors(water level, water temperature, electrical conductivity, CO2, Taux Ammonia Nitrogen(TAN), etc.), and actuators (water pump, etc.,) in aquaponics farming. This paper provides an innovative solution based on an interoperable, secure, scalable, low-cost, fully self-powered, flexible, reliable and generic IoT architecture that meets the requirements of aquaponics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The building sector is the highest energy consumer and ranks first in terms of carbon emissions among all sectors. To address these issues, decarbonization and electrification in the building energy sector are two critical missions of the new US administration. For decarbonization, the new administration has set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50–52\\\\% by 2030 and targeting a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. For electrification, the goal is to achieve 100\\\\% clean electricity by 2035. Such decarbonization and electrification in the building sector require that energy consumption in buildings be reduced significantly. Therefore, the building sector must continuously adopt new technologies to achieve its energy and carbon emission goals. One of the most fundamental technologies is the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has proven to be an effective solution for the building domain, including building information/energy modeling, smart buildings, etc. Although much progress has been made in the development of IoT-based building energy systems, there is still a lack of reliable, scalable, and affordable IoT-based automated fault and degradation diagnostic (AFDD) solutions. Such solutions would enable deployment of advanced algorithms into real systems to archive the projected energy benefits.

       "  'abstract': 'To better manage human resources (HR), companies are increasingly incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and other AI-based tools into their HR management (HRM) strategies, at a universal scale. Companies on a global scale, highlight the employment prospects and use of resources, business judgment, and make predictions using machine learning approaches. This work aims at the situation that the human resource department faces high employee turnover in the company especially some experienced employees leave. The termination of an employee is predicted by using an enhanced ID3 decision tree with ABC rule miner. The best-classifying attributes are chosen by ID3 and association rules are mined to generate an enhanced decision tree to perform classification. It is then passed to the regressor model to make prediction. Gradient descent optimizer is used for optimizing the proposed machine learning model. Predictive analysis is done in HR dataset v-14 by visualizing and analyzing and exploiting the behavioral relationship among the attributes. The variables of employee termination are predicted by a data-driven predictive analysis from the performance measure metrics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Future agricultural systems should increase productivity and sustainability of food production and supply. For this, integrated and efficient capture, management, sharing, and use of agricultural and environmental data from multiple sources is essential. However, there are challenges to understand and efficiently use different types of agricultural and environmental data from multiple sources, which differ in format and time interval. In this regard, the role of emerging technologies is considered to be significant for integrated data gathering, analyses and efficient use. In this study, a concept was developed to facilitate the full integration of digital technologies to enhance future smart and sustainable agricultural systems. The concept has been developed based on the results of a literature review and diverse experiences and expertise which enabled the identification of stat-of-the-art smart technologies, challenges and knowledge gaps. The features of the proposed solution include: data collection methodologies using smart digital tools; platforms for data handling and sharing; application of Artificial Intelligent for data integration and analysis; edge and cloud computing; application of Blockchain, decision support system; and a governance and data security system. The study identified the potential positive implications i.e. the implementation of the concept could increase data value, farm productivity, effectiveness in monitoring of farm operations and decision making, and provide innovative farm business models. The concept could contribute to an overall increase in the competitiveness, sustainability, and resilience of the agricultural sector as well as digital transformation in agriculture and rural areas. This study also provided future research direction in relation to the proposed concept. The results will benefit researchers, practitioners, developers of smart tools, and policy makers supporting the transition to smarter and more sustainable agriculture systems.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Smart Grid (SG) network is envisioned as the next-generation network for intelligent and efficient electric power transmission. In SG environment, the Smart Meters (SMs) mostly exchange services and data from Service Providers (SPs) via insecure public channel. This makes the entire SG ecosystem vulnerable to various security threats. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we incorporate Digital Twin (DT) technology, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Deep Learning (DL) and blockchain into the design of a novel SG network. Specifically, a secure communication channel is first designed using an authentication method based on blockchain technology that has the ability to withstand a number of well-known assaults. Second, a new DL architecture that includes a self-attention mechanism, a Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) model, fully connected layers, and a softmax classifier is designed to enhance the attack detection process in SG environments. To deliver low latency and real-time services, the SDN is next employed as the network’s backbone to send requests from SMs to a global SDN controller. DT technology is finally integrated into the SDN control plane, which stores the operating states and behavior models of SMs and communicates with SMs. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated by the blockchain implementation used in the SG network to assess computing time for the various numbers of transactions per block. Finally, the numerical results based on the N-BaIoT dataset shows better intrusion detection.',\n",

Internet of Things (IoT) and deep learning (DL) were proposed to perform soluble solids content (SSC) model transfer of apple by NIR. A model transfer platform including low-power handheld internal quality terminal and interacting cloud data system had been constructed. An autoencoder (AE) neural network model was developed for the spectral correction and model transfer. The average time for transmitting detection results to the detection terminal was 1.5 to 2.0 s, with a 100\\\\% effective transmission rate. After 5000 iterations of training, the correlation coefficient of different detection terminals improved by 55\\\\%, and the root mean square error was reduced by 94\\\\%. Selected samples from the second batch of apples detected by the No. 1 detection terminal were added to the original neural network for training. After adding 30 samples, the correlation coefficient increased by 13\\\\% and the root mean square error decreased by 90\\\\%. The results demonstrated that the AE neural network for spectral correction was effective in eliminating differences between devices and significantly reducing the impact of different detection terminals on the accuracy of NIR detection of SSC in apples. Therefore, the NIR detection model transfer technique could be practically exploited for fruit quality control assessment using different detection terminals.',\n",

Subsequently, we also address the resulting problem of sensing and processing resource-intensive data aerially within the Edge swarm in the fastest and most efficient manner possible. The heterogeneous nature of the Edge swarm results in under-utilization of the available computation resources due to unequal data generation within its members. To address this, we propose a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra-Edge processing offload scheme to mitigate the problem of heavy processing in some of the swarm members. We do this by distributing the data to be processed to all the swarm members. Real-life hardware tuned simulation of a large UAV swarm shows that by increasing the number of UAVs in the swarm, our scheme achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays for intensive processing tasks. Additionally, in comparison to regular star and mesh topologies, our scheme achieves an increase in collective available network processing speeds by 100\\\\% for only 25\\\\% of the number of UAVs in a star topology.',\n",

The Processing Packages are designed to communicate through the Internet of Things (IoT) based on the Accident Reduction Model (ARM) and Augmented Data Recognition (ADR) system.When ECG signals are sensed through IoT and sent to the cloud for the analysis purpose, delays are caused by the time results reach the medical staff.

       "  'abstract': 'The current advancement in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices is revolutionizing conventional farming operations into precision agriculture. The agricultural UAVs combined with IoT use an open channel i.e., the Internet to assist cultivators with data collection, processing, monitoring, and making correct decisions on the farm. However, the use of the Internet opens up a wide range of challenges such as security (e.g., performing cyber-attacks), risk of data privacy (e.g., data poisoning and inference attacks), etc. The usage of current conventional centralized security measures has limitations in terms of a single point of failure, verifiability, traceability, and scalability. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Secured Privacy-Preserving Framework (SP2F) for smart agricultural UAVs. The proposed SP2F framework has two main engines, a two-level privacy engine, and a deep learning-based anomaly detection engine. In the two-level privacy engine, a blockchain, and smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) is designed for data authentication, and to mitigate data poisoning attacks. A Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) is applied for transforming data into a new encoded format for preventing inference attacks. In the anomaly detection engine, a Stacked Long-Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) is used to train and evaluate the results of the proposed two-level privacy engine using two publicly accessible IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and IoT Botnet. Finally, based on thorough analysis, and comparison, we identify that the SP2F framework outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both non-blockchain and blockchain frameworks.',\n",

Green IoT applications based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are developed in various domains, such as medical, engineering, industry, and smart cities to grow the production. To increase the performance of sustainable cities, communicating nodes are interconnected autonomously to observe the environment, where they need to be more energy-efficient. Edge computing operates in a distributed manner and improves the response time with the least latency through various edge servers. Although the integration of edge computing and Green IoT significantly improves the network performance in terms of computation and data storage, low powered sensors have constraints in terms of battery power, low transmission range, and security aspects. Therefore, adopting an emerging solution is needed to offer energy services with secure data delivery for sustainable cities. This paper presents an intelligent and secure edge-enabled computing (ISEC) model for sustainable cities using Green IoT, which aims to develop the communication strategy with decreasing the liability in terms of energy management and data security for data transportation. The proposed model generates optimal features using deep learning for data routing, which may help to train the sensors for predicting the finest routes toward edge servers. Moreover, the integration of distributed hashing with chaining strategy eases security solutions with efficient computing system. The experimental results reveal the improved performance of the proposed ISEC model against other solutions for energy consumption by 21 \\\\%, network throughput by 15 \\\\%, end-to-end delay by 12 \\\\%, route interruption by 36 \\\\%, and network overhead by 52 \\\\%.',\n",

Digital forensics experts face a daunting task of handling these cyberattacks because of the unique and complex challenges posed by IoT. Recently, researchers have been drawn to finding solutions to these challenges, however, this is still in its infancy. This paper carries out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the current research advancements in IoT forensics. We define key IoT fundamentals, IoT applications, the need for IoT forensics, identify the key factors affecting IoT forensics, and review the practicality of the available IoT forensics frameworks, models, and methodologies. The SLR reveals research gaps indicating that most of the current research is more theoretical than practical. There is a need for more practical approaches to tackle the unique IoT forensics challenges.

       "  'abstract': 'Supply Chain Management (SCM) consists of handling and optimizing all the facets of the supply chain process of goods and services. Modern SCM is reaping the benefits from the emerging and growing Internet of Things (IoT) field. IoT technology can automate and digitalize the supply chain processes to get maximum operational efficiencies by reducing operating costs. The mass proliferation of IoT devices has revolutionized supply chains. IoT devices in the supply chain process track and trace shipments using the latest real-time monitoring technologies, including GPS. IoT devices are also used for asset management using NFC technology and RFID tags. Overall, IoT devices are used in almost every stage of the supply chain process. Research on IoT-based SCM is still in the growing phase. A lot of technical work is currently being published on IoT-based SCM, but a few Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been found for IoT-based SCM. The holistic view of IoT-based SCM with detailed analysis is still not reported in any review. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting an SLR on IoT-based SCM with a detailed analysis of IoT-based SCM from 2018 to 2022. This review covers the aspects of IoT-based SCM, such as application domains, technologies, sensors, and devices used to implement IoT-based SCM systems. The SLR findings will assist future researchers and practitioners interested in IoT-based SCM by offering an in-depth study of the literature on IoT-based SCM, including helpful insights on challenges, benefits, and economic and business implications.',\n",

The time required for individualized training may be shortened, and the dependability of complicated equipment may be increased. This study recommends a real-time remote patient monitoring system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to assure the accuracy of the vital real-time signal.

A real-time tracking and monitoring application can be used to track vessels and containers in the first application. In addition to managing traffic or allocating priority and services to vessels moving through the port jurisdiction, information about vessels and containers can also be utilized to stack containers optimally at the port terminals. Thirdly, the Internet of Things facilitates the transition from manual to automated ports/terminals. Fourth, they can spend less time interacting with customers daily.

       "  'abstract': 'Mortality is an important production and fish welfare indicator in aquaculture. Unusual mortality patterns can be associated with abiotic or/and biotic stresses on fish in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Real or near real-time mortality tracking can provide valuable inputs to farm managers, to make informed RAS management decisions and address root causes in an effort to prevent mass mortality events. While traditional systems use infrequent human operator observation and tracking - often in conjunction with an underwater camera - the proposed tool (i.e., ‘MortCam’) augments this approach with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) deployed at the Edge to provide round-the-clock mortality monitoring and trigger alerts when mortality thresholds are exceeded. MortCam consists of an imaging sensor integrated with an edge computing device, customized for underwater applications. MortCam was deployed in a 150 m3 circular dual-drain RAS tank at 0.6 m above the bottom drain plate to acquire the imagery data in both ambient and supplemental light conditions. The images were collected every fifteen minutes for 90 days. Acquired images were annotated either as ‘alive’ or ‘dead’ fish and split into training (70 \\\\%), validation (20 \\\\%), and test (10 \\\\%) datasets to train a custom YOLOv7 mortality detection model. The optimized mixed model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) and F1 score of 93.4 \\\\% and 0.89, respectively. Additionally, the model performed well in terms of mortality count and was found robust despite changes in the imaging conditions. The model was deployed on the MortCam to achieve round-the-clock autonomous mortality monitoring. The system reliably generated email and text alerts to notify fish production staff of unusual mortality events.',\n",

However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies. Such impacts span all operational departments including marketing, where these technologies help satisfy customer needs; the industrial and operational area, which is provided with quality products; and where productivity and economic performance are optimised for more efficiency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture Internet of Things (AIoTs) deployments require design of high-efficiency Quality of Service (QoS) \\\\& security models that can provide stable network performance even under large-scale communication requests. Existing security models that use blockchains are either highly complex or require large delays \\\\& have higher energy consumption for larger networks. Moreover, the efficiency of these models depends directly on consensus-efficiency \\\\& miner-efficiency, which restricts their scalability under real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the design of an efficient Q-Learning bioinspired model for enhancing QoS of AIoT deployments via customized shards. The model initially collects temporal information about the deployed AIoT Nodes, and continuously updates individual recurring trust metrics. These trust metrics are used by a Q-Learning process for identification of miners that can participate in the block-addition process. The blocks are added via a novel Proof-of-Performance (PoP) based consensus model, which uses a dynamic consensus function that is based on temporal performance of miner nodes. The PoP consensus is facilitated via customized shards, wherein each shard is deployed based on its context of deployment, that decides the shard-length, hashing model used for the shard, and encryption technique used by these shards. This is facilitated by a Mayfly Optimization (MO) Model that uses PoP scores for selecting shard configurations. These shards are further segregated into smaller shards via a Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) Model, which assists in identification of optimal shard length for underlying deployment contexts. Due to these optimizations, the model is able to improve the speed of mining by 4.5\\\\%, while reducing energy needed for mining by 10.4\\\\%, improving the throughput during AIoT communications by 8.3\\\\%, and improving the packet delivery consistency by 2.5\\\\% when compared with existing blockchain-based AIoT deployment models under similar scenarios. This performance was observed to be consistent even under large-scale attacks.',\n",

SSR takes into account reliability, delays due to transmission, reception and processing of the neighbors’ information, and energy consumption and remaining energy of IoT devices. Through our proposed mathematical model, a dataset is generated to train a deep neural network, which predicts the best routing path from source to destination and achieves substantial accuracy over the mathematically generated dataset.

While the rapid evolution of IoTs has facilitated monumental opportunities for humanity, it has also acted as a catalyst precipitating diverse security issues. Cybercrimes have been on the rise as criminals and hackers continue to take advantage of IoT's security loopholes and vulnerabilities. The enormity of the attacks has not only been damaging to the quality of life, but it poses a disservice and an unquantifiable risk to human safety. Thus, a timely and comprehensive review, analysis and investigation of the security of IoTs is crucial. Through a systematic literature review of over 200 articles, we set out the latest findings and trends to provide new insights into the security of IoTs, taking cognizant of its social, economic, technical and legal implications, which will be beneficial to researchers, manufacturers, individuals, organizations, and governments. Although many studies reviewing the state of IoT exist in the literature, no studies shape the area of its security well. Hence, there is currently no study that provides an in-depth survey of the emerging security concerns of IoT from diverse perspectives and in tandem with the current condition of the global world today. Compared to other related reviews on the security of IoTs, this survey encompasses much more technical angles to the security of IoT. It begins with the review of the concept of IoTs, the assessments of its industrial development trends, revolutionary paradigms and updated security of the IoT. Key challenges in the security of blockchain technology, a recent spike in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic are sensitive areas that have remained untouched by previous review works. Additionally, politics and security of electoral votes, forensic issues in the IoT era and much more are some of the new depths missing in the literature of IoT security.

This paper proposes a new packets' scheduling strategy for CRIoT. It is a centralized time slotted algorithm that uses discrete permutation particle swarm optimization for scheduling packets among predicted primary network empty time slots. An objective function is formulated to maximize the fairness index among fog nodes, minimize the packets' queuing delay and minimize the number of dropped packetsat each time interval. In order to evaluate the proposed protocol, it is implemented along with another protocol named spectrum auction. Using the fairness index, the average queuing delay and the number of dropped packets as evaluation metrics, simulation results proved that the proposed protocol outperforms the spectrum auction protocol.

       "  'abstract': 'Due to the increasing world population, demand for food products have created the need to modernize and intensify agricultural operations through precision agriculture. The Internet of Things offers a wide variety of solutions for precision agriculture, but implementing it in the agriculture field imposes challenges to hardware and data communication in the network. Importantly, the sensor nodes have to be reliable for long periods with the limited available battery power. In this connection, the goal of this paper is to propose an efficient data collection algorithm which improves the network lifetime of the wireless sensor network (WSN), decreases the energy hole issue and reduces the data collection delay. In the proposed work, the rendezvous points (RPs) in the network are selected based on the energy level of the nodes, data packet density and the distance to the RPs. Then the mobile sink (MS) moves to the RPs in the shortest possible path to collect the data from the data-powered points. A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called WOAXGWO is proposed to find the shortest path for the MS. To assess the performance, the network’s lifetime, energy consumption, and latency are considered. Simulation findings show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and are validated on a coconut farm to demonstrate its reliability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The growing demand for fresher and better quality food products has led various researchers to propose solutions in this field. Besides the increase in food production, the efficiency of food logistics must be improved to reduce waste. An efficient food supply chain also reduces the final cost of products, increases producers’ incomes, mitigates the environmental impacts, and allows transportation of fresher, healthier foods. Collection and analysis of information on product tracking and stakeholder demands can improve supply chain efficiency, providing important insights to managers. Technological solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twin (DT), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), have been proposed for monitoring and tracking products and analyzing data collected while supporting decision-making. However, there are still few studies about the integration of these technologies, especially DTs, intelligent models, and DLTs. Thus, this work presents a review of the application of these technologies for food logistics, identifying the main requirements and summarizing how they can be applied in each logistics stage. Related surveys are discussed to find gaps in the literature and six research questions are defined and answered, aiming to argue about how the chosen technologies can be applied and combined to attempt the identified requirements. Lastly, this work discusses research opportunities in the fresh food supply chain, presenting some open challenges for adoption while integrating these technologies.',\n",

The technological leap forward has given shelter to the umbrella of cyber-physical systems such as Smart Grids, Agriculture, and Healthcare. The exponential growth of vulnerable spots (the Internet of Things) in multi-layer cyber-physical systems is involuntarily contributing to malignant IoT-generated denial-of-service attacks. The IoT devices manifest a high degree of diversity in traffic patterns, and a single dataset is insufficient to cover fiducial attack scenarios. In addition, the research community is pressing to overcome other roadblocks, such as an optimal architecture for solution efficacy, performance issues, and the need for comprehensive validation of the proposed solutions. Methods The paper offers a five-stage defense framework for building a mitigation against IoT-based DDoS attacks. The article brings forth an amalgamated dataset concocted from InSDN, BoT-IoT, and UNSW-Sydney datasets and a simulated dataset for IoT-DDoS to the research community. The paper employs a multi-stage Stack-Ensembled framework at the heart of the solution pillared on physical devices' behavioral attributes, resulting in a universal defense approach. The experiment leverages fog computing with distributed computational nodes to reduce response latency. Furthermore, the paper implements attack-detection-as-a-service on top of the Docker framework for a cost-effective, reusable, and portable framework. The novel design of the framework presents a light mitigation scheme to the SDN controller, ensuring a negligible impact on the controller's performance. Results and Discussion The hand-crafted feature selection process reduced the features by 80\\\\%, demonstrating a high accuracy of 99.99\\\\% with benchmark datasets, 98.84\\\\% accuracy in the simulation environment, and collateral damage of 1.52\\\\%. The experiment observes encouraging values for vital performance parameters that researchers often miss to discuss. Furthermore, the paper thoroughly analyzes IoT-DDoS mitigation framework performance parameters.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Ensuring material provenance is widely considered a promising solution to the persistent issues related to material fraudulence in the construction industry. However, current strategies of managing construction logistics and supply chain perplex provenance tracing and tracking by adding too many intermediaries and using low technologies. By learning from the food industry which shares similar complexity, prolonged supply chain, and numerous stakeholders, this research aims to develop a framework deployable for material provenance tracing and tracking in the construction industry. It does so by mixing the uses of (a) cross-sectoral learning; (b) design science research; and (c) internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technology. The developed framework has four interconnected layers, namely the business layer with different stakeholders and activities, the IoT layer to collect the provenance footprints, the blockchain layer with a mainchain to store open provenance data and sidechains to store organizational private data, and the application layer to facilitate the management of quality, safety, payment, logistic and supply chain, and sustainability. The underpinning philosophy of the framework is to capture the IoT-driven provenance footprints and put them in custody in blockchain. The framework is further illustrated and refined by using a pilot construction project in Hong Kong, which was endeavored to track steel provenance from its adjacent Pearl River Delta, the so-called “World's Factory”. The framework shows enormous prospects, e.g., adopting digital twins, lifecycle traceability, improved efficiency, and transparent operations, meanwhile facing challenges, e.g., under-developed regulations, scalability issues, and information leakage risks, which all call for future research.\",\n",

Using IoT for irrigation based on soil moisture can help reduce waste. This study used multidimensional time series modeling to predict soil moisture using two years of data on a US farm, including factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather. The models assessed were machine learning algorithms like Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forests, Deep Learning's Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN), and Vector Autoregression as a reference model. Random Forest was the most efficient and stable model. Furthermore, the spectral temporal graph neural network could not outperform the reference model. Comparing Random Forest with univariate algorithms like Naive, Exponential Smoothing, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) showed univariate's better performance in 9 of 10 datasets, with ARIMA being best in 8. A substantial disparity is observed when considering the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric. ARIMA yields an MAPE of 0.052, while StemGNN reports 0.127 as the major difference. ARIMA achieves a MAPE of 0.046 for the minor difference, whereas StemGNN obtains 0.038. In the remaining eight datasets, ARIMA consistently outperforms StemGNN by at least 30\\\\%.

       "  'abstract': \"Blockchain (BLC) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two emerging technologies that have become popular among practitioners for improving the transparency, adaptability, and safety of any industry. This is especially critical for food security, as COVID-19 highlighted the vulnerability of food supply chain (FSC). However, Indian organizations are experiencing problems in implementing the integrated form of BLC-IoT due to limited knowledge and insufficient research. The current study aims to propose a conceptual framework to reduce the impact of adoption barriers against BLC-IoT in FSC. Thirteen key barriers were identified after a thorough literature review and consultation with experts. The relationship among barriers was established using Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMA℡) methods. The analysis shows that the lack of government regulation and workers' low competency significantly influence BLC-IoT adoption. The results also indicate the intricacy of decision-making by demonstrating that 9 of the 13 barriers were a part of the linkage cluster. The study outcome will help practitioners in developing and planning strategies for effective adoption of BLC-IoT in FSC.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Nowadays, artificial intelligence and sensor technology play a vital role in the agriculture field. The use of excess insecticides and fertilizers in farming poses a risk to human health. It is necessary to control them to ensure healthy crop production. Many techniques are used to identify the pest, suggest medications, and do soil nutrient analysis techniques separately. This paper applies the dual operator, Transition Probability Function (TPF), and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to process the pest's image discretely and continuously for applying the recommended insecticide. The mathematical model with the objective function is derived in this paper. The proposed system combines two major aspects in farming: pest identification and insecticide recommendation using machine vision and CNN. Secondly, the soil nutrient analysis uses a soil NPK sensor with the recommendation of fertilizers according to the obtained nutrient values. On-spot results are obtained, and the time required for insecticide recommendation is within 10 s, and for fertilizer recommendation, it is within 80 s. Successful identification of five pests, namely aphids, bollworms, leaf folder, leaf miner, and green stink bug, was done with more than 90\\\\% accuracy. The proposed approach is also compared with the other intelligent approaches, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and it is observed that the proposed TPF-CNN approach gives higher accuracy in the shortest time.\",\n",

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies hold tremendous potential for tackling key aspects of pandemic management and response. In the present review, we discuss the tremendous possibilities of AI technology in addressing the global challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we outline the multiple impacts of the current pandemic on public health, the economy, and society. Next, we focus on the innovative applications of advanced AI technologies in key areas such as COVID-19 prediction, detection, control, and drug discovery for treatment. Specifically, AI-based predictive analytics models can use clinical, epidemiological, and omics data to forecast disease spread and patient outcomes. Additionally, deep neural networks enable rapid diagnosis through medical imaging. Intelligent systems can support risk assessment, decision-making, and social sensing, thereby improving epidemic control and public health policies. Furthermore, high-throughput virtual screening enables AI to accelerate the identification of therapeutic drug candidates and opportunities for drug repurposing.

Even though additive manufacturing (AM) technologies possess the capability to personalize final products, they cannot be used for mass production of the 3D printed job on a large scale. Their inability to perform production processes for large-sized objects adds to the disadvantages. Consequently, the industries are hesitant regarding the idea of AM techniques to carry out commercial productions. Therefore, this research-based study aims to efficiently identify and utilize Industry 4.0 technologies to improve AM processes' reliability and mass 3D print smart materials for manufacturers globally. We explore the requirement for Industry 4.0 technologies for AM processes and study the advantages of the application of information technologies (IT) in AM. Further, we analyze how the Internet of Things (IoT) additive manufacturing integrated techniques will benefit the industries and material manufacturers. However, the paperwork is confined to theoretical work. Since automation in AM is a fledgling concept, the available material for research-based study is limited. We conclude that IoT application in AM improves production processes' efficiency followed by reduced manufacturing waste and fulfilled customer specifications.

       "  'abstract': 'Waste production is growing in most communities due to population expansion. Given the stated issue, managing the Solid Waste (SW) created worldwide would be vital. Effective Waste Management (WM) is essential to preserving the environment and lowering pollution. It aids in resource preservation, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and ecosystem protection. Additionally, the promotion of public health and sanitation is significantly aided by WM procedures. This study presents an integrated procedure to enhance the operations of a WM network for recycling SW. We propose a mathematical model to find the optimal sustainable vehicle routes, allocation, and Sequence Scheduling (SS) problem in the recycling industry to reduce costs and CO2 emissions and increase job opportunities. The fundamental innovation of this work is considering waste-vehicle and waste-technology compatibility and Internet of Things (IoT) systems in the model to decrease CO2 emissions and identify compatible waste for recycling centers to produce more final products. An LP-metric and an Epsilon Constraint (EC) approach are used to solve the suggested model. By comparing the two approaches, we have found EC performs better in results and CPU time. As a result, various test problems of different sizes are offered. Accordingly, sensitivity analyses are recommended to assess the suggested model’s effectiveness. Using vehicles compatible with waste reduces CO2 emissions. Utilizing IoT technology and optimization methods makes it feasible to save costs (20\\\\%), have a less destructive impact on the environment (36\\\\%), and ultimately increase the sustainability of the WM process.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies has revolutionized agricultural practices worldwide. However, their application in the context of sub-Saharan Africa remains a critical challenge. This study presents a systematic review that investigates the potential of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation. Sub-Saharan Africa faces multiple agricultural challenges, exacerbated by climate change, water scarcity, and inefficient irrigation practices. The need for sustainable, water-efficient, and data-driven irrigation systems is urgent to ensure food security and economic development in the region. This study addresses a crucial knowledge gap by assessing the constraints, opportunities, and prospects of implementing 4IR technologies for smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa. A systematic review methodology was employed, utilizing reputable databases including Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and PubMed. A comprehensive search strategy was designed to identify peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and reports related to the application of Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Big Data, and Blockchain technology in smart irrigation. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was used to arrive at 95 articles included in this research. The review reveals promising trends in the integration of 4IR technologies for smart irrigation. 4IR technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data technology, Blockchain and drones are widely used in smart irrigation. These technologies have facilitated real time monitoring of soil moisture and weather conditions, precision irrigation scheduling, water allocation optimization, rapid data collection, insights in real time crop water use and transparency and trust in agricultural water management among others. While the potential of 4IR technologies is evident, challenges including limited infrastructure, access to technology, and technical expertise pose significant barriers for the adoption in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the high initial costs associated with these technologies can impede widespread adoption. The study highlights the potential to leverage existing mobile phone penetration for IoT data collection, collaborative partnerships, and innovative financing models to overcome financial constraints. Capacity-building initiatives and knowledge transfer can empower local communities to embrace these technologies. The future of smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa relies on policy support, investments, and technology diffusion strategies. It is imperative to create an enabling environment that fosters innovation and addresses the unique needs of the region. Collaboration between governments, academia, industry, and international organizations can catalyze the transformative impact of 4IR technologies, ultimately enhancing irrigation sustainability and food security.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture is by its nature a complicated scientific field, related to a wide range of expertise, skills, methods and processes which can be effectively supported by computerized systems. There have been many efforts towards the establishment of an automated agriculture framework, capable to control both the incoming data and the corresponding processes. The recent advances in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) domain have the capability to collect, process and analyze data from different sources while materializing the concept of agriculture intelligence. The thriving environment for the implementation of different agriculture systems is justified by a series of technologies that offer the prospect of improving agricultural productivity through the intensive use of data. The concept of big data in agriculture is not exclusively related to big volume, but also on the variety and velocity of the collected data. Big data is a key concept for the future development of agriculture as it offers unprecedented capabilities and it enables various tools and services capable to change its current status. This survey paper covers the state-of-the-art agriculture systems and big data architectures both in research and commercial status in an effort to bridge the knowledge gap between agriculture systems and exploitation of big data. The first part of the paper is devoted to the exploration of the existing agriculture systems, providing the necessary background information for their evolution until they have reached the current status, able to support different platforms and handle multiple sources of information. The second part of the survey is focused on the exploitation of multiple sources of information, providing information for both the nature of the data and the combination of different sources of data in order to explore the full potential of ICT systems in agriculture.',\n",

This is an efficient method to use in every field to reduce manpower, energy usage, and also for improving the quality, accuracy, precision, and efficiency of any system. The home automation system helps in automating various aspects of life. The invention of advanced technologies and computing methodology helps in automating various activities in the home, often termed as a smart home. Through this automated process, the user can easily closely monitor various activities at home. The computing technologies like the Internet of Things, evolutionary algorithm, data science, and machine learning (ML) algorithms help to analyze, predict, and smartly monitor the home activities. The integration of ML and artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing day by day in managing a smart home. Home automation can help in managing energy consumption, intruder detection, fire detection, gas leakage, and any abnormal activities in and surrounding the home. For example, our home kitchens can be upgraded with the integration of AI and ML to improve the functioning of pantries, fridges, stoves, cooking, and energy efficiency.

       "  'abstract': \"Ensuring agro-farm security has become a paramount challenge in the context of Bangladesh's growing agricultural sector. In response to the escalating challenges of theft and aggressive activities plaguing agricultural farms in Bangladesh, this research presents an innovative IoT-based smart agro-farm security system. Through comprehensive system design, program development, and testing, the system detects unauthorised access and triggers alarms, sending real-time notifications to the farmer's house and mobile device. The system consists of a sender station (farm shed) and two receiver stations (farmer's house and mobile device). The sender station integrates a range of sensors (laser and vibration sensors), including GSM and a transceiver controlled by an Arduino Mega. The receiver stations comprise an Arduino UNO, indicator lights, high-sound alarms, and remote access on the farmer's mobile device. Testing showed 100\\\\% responsiveness for the laser sensor and 90\\\\% for the vibration sensor. This system went through a rigorous process of testing which resulted in an overall system efficiency of 90\\\\%. This innovative solution empowers farmers and agro-farm entrepreneurs to protect their valuable assets, contributing to enhanced farm security in Bangladesh and promoting agricultural industry sustainability.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging field of technology with a huge scope of its applicability in various industries and a wide range of societal needs, including medical sciences. However, IoT suffers from many limitations like energy, resource constraints, scalability, security, availability, etc. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another similar technology that has many features that are capable of solving many of the limitations of the conventional IoT system. So, suitably incorporating SDN technology into the conventional IoT system, an improved version of IoT namely an SDN-based IoT network system has been evolved. This system is capable of resolving many of the limitations of IoT. Since this newer SDN-based IoT version is enriched with better energy and resources, it can undertake higher computational loads to resolve security issues. In the security domain, Blockchain is a state-of-the-art security-based technology in recent times which has already been implemented in the fields of cryptocurrency effectively. So, Many research opportunities emerge out in adapting Blockchain-based technology suitable for the SDN-based IoT Networking domain. This paper deals with the investigations carried out by the past researchers on various security aspects of the IoT, SDN, and SDN-based IoT systems and their solutions using various technologies, including that of Blockchain. It was concluded that the convergence of Blockchain in IoT and SDN and its combination (SDN-based IoT) resolved many security issues. Many prominent research gaps still persist here to be resolved. This can be dealt with as a future scope of research opportunities in the domain.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"One of the essential aspects in managing food safety is the drying, which helps to preserve food quality and extend the shelf life of food products. The temperature, relative humidity (RH), and air velocity in dryers should be carefully monitored and maintained to ensure food quality and safety during the drying process. Also, the components of heat pump dryers are at risk due to the electric current, the high temperature surrounding the condensing unit's compressor, and the high air velocity of the drying environment. These elements affect the quality of the foods being dried, and being able to communicate alerts in real-time is essential for taking precautions against hazards that can damage the dryer's internal components. Food technology's IoT-based control (IoT-BC) system with multipurpose sensors offers options for managing the post-harvest quality of leaves as they are being dried. This study set out to design and evaluates an IoT-BC system in order to remotely control, alert of imminent hazards, and monitor the microclimate parameters, including RH, temperature, and air velocity. The impacts of the created IoT-based drying system on the quality of dried leafy vegetables were also investigated utilizing a unique dryer as a case study. The results showed that the created IoT-BC system accurately maintained the drying environment, provided reliable data about the internal microclimate atmosphere of the dryer, and provided the appropriate alarm in case of an emergency and this was based on real-time data analyses. The most important quality characteristics for dried leaves were not significantly different between the IoT-based dryer and the conventional dryer dependant on drying time. Rehydration capacity decreased with the increase in the drying air temperature from 40 to 70 °C and was maximum (6.48) at 40 °C for coriander leaves and maximum (5.59) at 40 °C for Mint leaves dried in IoT based dryer. Maximum crude fibre and protein contents for mint leaves dried in an IoT-based drier were at 40 °C and were 4.97 mg/100 g and 10.62 mg/100 g, respectively. Maximum crude fibre and protein contents for coriander leaves dried in this method were 3.76 mg/100 g and 12.23 mg/100 g, respectively. The IoT based dryer kept the leaves' superior qualities throughout the drying process as a result.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The reliability problems caused by random failure or malicious attacks in the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly severe, while a highly robust network topology is the basis for highly reliable Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, improving the robustness of the IoT against cyber-attacks by optimizing the network topology becomes a vital issue. Heuristic algorithms as the mainstream idea to solve the network robustness optimization, but their high computational cost cannot meet the timeliness requirements of real IoT scenarios. This paper proposes a Smart Topology Robustness Optimization (SmartTRO) algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). First, we design a rewiring operation as an evolutionary behavior in IoT network topology robustness optimization, which achieves topology optimization at a low cost without changing the degree of all nodes. Then, SmartTRO learns the evolutionary behavior characteristics of IoT network topology by combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and policy network, where the training of neural network parameters is completed by DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartTRO improves the ability of IoT topology to resist cyber-attacks effectively and outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm in terms of both topology robustness optimization performance and computational cost.',\n",

Many virtual environments have been developed with immersive experience and digital transformation, but most are incoherent instead of being integrated into a platform. In this context, metaverse has been introduced as a shared virtual world that is fueled by many emerging technologies. Among such technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the great importance of enhancing immersive experience and enabling human-like intelligence of virtual agents. In this survey, we make a beneficial effort to explore the role of AI, including machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures, in the foundation and development of the metaverse. As the main contributions, we convey a comprehensive investigation of AI-based methods concerning several technical aspects (e.g., natural language processing, machine vision, blockchain, networking, digital twin, and neural interface) that have potentials to build virtual worlds in the metaverse. Furthermore, several primary AI-aided applications, including healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and gaming, are studied to be promisingly deployed in the virtual worlds. Finally, we conclude the key contribution and open some future research directions of AI for the metaverse. Serving as a foundational survey, this work will help researchers, including experts and non-experts in related fields, in applying, developing, and optimizing AI techniques to polish the appearance of virtual worlds and improve the quality of applications built in the metaverse.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In the field of information and communication technology, the Internet of Things is regarded as a brand-new and important technology. The introduction of new protocols in this area is caused by the presence of devices in these networks with constrained resources and relatively low computing power. One of the most well-known routing protocols for low-power devices is the RPL protocol. This algorithm cannot take into account all of the required routing goals at once. This article introduces a proposed data-oriented RPL algorithm that divides data during routing according to their content. This can decrease the amount of duplicate data transferred through the network, shorten the communication system's delay, conserve the node's limited energy, and prolong the network's lifespan. The effectiveness of RPL can be increased by selecting the best route utilizing the Binary Gray Wolf Optimization. The best parent node in the routing procedure is chosen using an objective function during the tree construction phase. This objective function is built using fuzzy logic and the Binary Gray Wolf Optimization in the suggested technique. The results of Matlab 2022a and OMNET environment tests have shown that the proposed method has increased the efficiency of energy consumption and reduced the period of instability and end-to-end delay. that the ratio of the instability period in the proposed method is much less than the other three methods, so that the ratio of the instability period is 57\\\\% for the proposed method in the ORPL and Qos RPL methods, it is equal to 80\\\\%, and in the RPL method it is equal to 89\\\\%. This problem shows that the proposed method is more stable, or, in other words, it has been active for a longer period of time with the maximum number of nodes.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cloud computing provides resources over the Internet and allows a plethora of applications to be deployed to provide services for different industries. The major bottleneck being faced currently in these cloud frameworks is their limited scalability and hence inability to cater to the requirements of centralized Internet of Things (IoT) based compute environments. The main reason for this is that latency-sensitive applications like health monitoring and surveillance systems now require computation over large amounts of data (Big Data) transferred to centralized database and from database to cloud data centers which leads to drop in performance of such systems. The new paradigms of fog and edge computing provide innovative solutions by bringing resources closer to the user and provide low latency and energy efficient solutions for data processing compared to cloud domains. Still, the current fog models have many limitations and focus from a limited perspective on either accuracy of results or reduced response time but not both. We proposed a novel framework called HealthFog for integrating ensemble deep learning in Edge computing devices and deployed it for a real-life application of automatic Heart Disease analysis. HealthFog delivers healthcare as a fog service using IoT devices and efficiently manages the data of heart patients, which comes as user requests. Fog-enabled cloud framework, FogBus is used to deploy and test the performance of the proposed model in terms of power consumption, network bandwidth, latency, jitter, accuracy and execution time. HealthFog is configurable to various operation modes which provide the best Quality of Service or prediction accuracy, as required, in diverse fog computation scenarios and for different user requirements.',\n",

The main concept of the sustainable smart city is established for collecting and negotiation of the Internet of things (IoT) devices and smart applications to help and enhancement of human life. On the other hand, energy harvesting management as an important issue in sustainable urban computing has several challenges arising from the exponential growth of IoT devices, smart applications, and complex population to decrease the related factors on the energy consumption, power-saving, and environmental waste management. However, the notion of energy harvesting management for sustainable urban computing is still growing exponentially, and it should be attended to due to economic factors and governmental obstacles. This paper reviews different existing green energy harvesting strategies on the smart applications of sustainable and smart cities in edge-based intelligent urban computing. The existing energy harvesting strategies have been divided into five categories: smart home management, smart cities, smart grids, smart environmental systems, and smart transportation systems. This review aims to classify technical aspects of energy harvesting management methods in sustainable urban computing concerning applied algorithms, evaluation factors, and evaluation environments. As technical results, a general discussion is essential for the development of existing challenges and open research directions of energy harvesting and waste management for sustainable smart cities that contribute expressively to enhance the energy consumption of smart applications and human life in complex and metropolitan areas.',\n",

These global challenges pose direct threats to food security and safety and clearly show the urgent need for innovative scientific solutions and technological approaches. Backed by the current alarming situation, many food-related trends have emerged in recent years in response to these global issues. This review looks at two megatrends in agriculture and the food industry; the shift to vegetable diets and the digital transformation in food production and consumption patterns. On one side, several innovative technologies and protein sources have been associated with more sustainable food systems and enhanced nutritional quality and safety. On the other side, many digital advanced technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and 3D printing) have been increasingly applied in smart farms and smart food factories to improve food system outcomes. Increasing adoption of vegetal innovations and harnessing Industry 4.0 technologies along the food supply chain have the potential to enable efficient digital and ecological transitions.',\n",

The traditional solutions do not fit the new challenges brought by the IoT ecosystem. Although the development's area of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) provides an opportunity to improve security issues and create a fertile and exciting environment for further research and experiments, there is not any systematic and comprehensive study about analyzing its importance for IoT environment. Therefore, this work aims to identify, evaluate, and perform a comprehensive study of empirical research on the studies of AIS approaches to secure the IoT environment. The relevant and high-quality studies are addressing using three research questions about the main research motivations, existing solutions, and future gaps and directions. The AIS approaches have been divided into three main categories based on IoT layers, and detailed classifications have also been included based on different parameters. To achieve this aim, the authors use a systematic literature review (SLR) as a powerful method to collect and critically analyze the research papers. Also, the authors discuss the selected studies and their main techniques, as well as their benefits and drawbacks in general. This research process strives to build a knowledge base for AIS solutions under the umbrella of IoT security and suggest directions for future research.\",\n",

The study aims to improve the efficiency of power inspection in power enterprises and provide intelligent technology for power inspection. After the theoretical analysis of IoT and RFID technology under the background of smart city, the study discusses the information acquisition principle of RFID technology. Second, based on IoT and smart grid, the study takes the power equipment of power company A as an example, and puts forward the power inspection scheme, including the information required for inspection and the inspection of primary and secondary equipment. The specific contents are as follows: health assessment is carried out according to the real-time alarm of power equipment, and the control command is sent to the downstream control equipment to confirm the alarm information. Meantime, based on the alarm information of power equipment and related equipment, the expert analysis system is used for reasoning and analysis, and the RFID tag is used to supervise the inspectors to arrive at the site and inspect the situation according to the predetermined route. The temperature of the cable of power company A is measured under normal and hidden dangers, and the body insulation test is conducted on No. 1 main transformer. The results show that under normal operation, the cable temperature at each point is slightly different, which is basically about 40 °C. The temperature before the fourth point of the cable rises obviously, indicating that the fourth point has faulty. Over time, the more chemical molecules are detected in phase A. When phase B and phase C are tested on the same day, the difference of chemical molecular content is relatively small. It indicates that the chemical molecular content detected by chromatographic test of bulk insulating oil is normal. To sum up, smart power, as the objective need of urban intelligent development, is an important foundation of smart city. The power inspection scheme based on IoT and RFID technology proposed has high detection efficiency.',\n",

However, with the increasing world's population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research studies (69\\\\%), contrary to indoor farms (31\\\\%). Moreover, it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities.\",\n",

Adopting wake-up radio (WuR)-enabled wireless sensor nodes can effectively reduce delay, but the deployment costs of the network increase. In this paper, we propose a delay differentiated services routing (DDSR) scheme to reduce the deployment costs for WuR-enabled wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Urgent data prefer to select the awake non-WuR node to forward data. If there is no available awake non-WuR node to forward data at the instant, it will awaken WuR nodes alternatively to maintain a relatively low delay. However, normal data are forwarded by the awake non-WuR node to reduce the number of deployed WuR nodes. Our theoretical analysis results demonstrate that the DDSR scheme can effectively reduce the deployment costs by 93.63\\\\%–98.91\\\\% while meeting the delay requirement of forwarding urgent data and maintaining a long lifetime.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"With the continuous advancement of science and technology, there has been a growing awareness of safety among people worldwide. Natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, and floods pose persistent threats to both lives and property on our planet, which serves as our fundamental habitat. While it is impossible to prevent or entirely avert these calamities, rapid identification of affected areas and prompt damage assessment post-disaster can significantly aid in the formulation of effective rescue strategies, ultimately saving more lives. This article delves into the application of transfer learning in satellite image damage assessment—a methodology that involves transferring previously acquired knowledge to enhance a model's adaptability to new tasks. Given the limited availability of datasets for satellite image analysis, transfer learning proves to be an effective approach. Specifically, the study proposes a transfer learning method based on YOLOv5 for satellite image damage assessment. Initially, a general convolutional neural network model is trained using a substantial dataset of natural images. Subsequently, the early layers of this model are frozen, while the later layers undergo training to adapt to satellite image data. Fine-tuning is then employed to further enhance the overall model performance. The results demonstrate that this approach yields a high accuracy rate in satellite image damage assessment. Moreover, compared to conventional deep learning methods, the proposed method effectively leverages pre-trained models' knowledge, thereby reducing data dependency. Additionally, it displays robust generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and datasets, underscoring its potential for facilitating transfer learning across various domains.\",\n",

However, IoT devices adopted to monitor microclimate are expensive to people in developing countries. This study proposed a hybrid deep learning model (ConvLSTM*CNN-BP) without using IoT data to produce accurate multi-horizon and multi-factor (greenhouse internal temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation) forecasts simultaneously. The proposed model fused a convolutional-based long short term memory neural network (ConvLSTM), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). Model construction involved an ensemble of gridded 6-hour-ahead meteorological forecasts from the STMAS-WRF model and 3-hour-ahead greenhouse internal temperature simulated by a physically-based model at a 10-min scale. Another deep learning model (CNN*LSTM*Stacked LSTM-BP) using IoT data was established for comparison purpose. The experimental results on two greenhouses located in Central Taiwan indicated that the proposed model (non-IoT) and the benchmark model (with IoT) produced similar forecast performances on greenhouse internal temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation. Moreover, the proposed model with illustrious abilities of noise removal and feature extraction could provide satisfactory forecast accuracy. The proposed deep learning approach hits a milestone in multi-horizon and multi-factor forecasting on microclimate, which significantly supports farmers, especially in developing countries, in reducing the installation and maintenance costs of IoT devices for monitoring purpose.',\n",

Recent technological advancements have given rise to several resources and technologies that are boosting particular facets of society. Many researchers are now interested in studying MEH systems for ultra-low power IoT sensors and WSNs. A comprehensive study of IoT will help to manage a single MEH as a power source for multiple WSNs. The popular database from Scopus was used in this study to perform a review analysis of the MEH system for ultra-low power IoT sensors. All relevant and important literature studies published in this field were statistically analysed using a review analysis method by VOSviewer software, and research gaps, challenges and recommendations of this field were investigated. The findings of the study indicate that there has been an increasing number of literature studies published on the subject of MEH systems for IoT platforms throughout time, particularly from 2013 to 2023. The results demonstrate that 67\\\\% of manuscripts highlight problem-solving, modelling and technical overview, simulation, experimental setup and prototype. In observation, 27\\\\% of papers are based on bibliometric analysis, systematic review, survey, review and based on case study, and 2\\\\% of conference manuscripts are based on modelling, simulation, and review analysis. The top-cited articles are published in 5 different countries and 9 publishers including IEEE 51\\\\%, Elsevier 16\\\\%, MDPI 10\\\\% and others. In addition, several MEH system-related problems and challenges are noted to identify current limitations and research gaps, including technical, modelling, economic, power quality, and environmental concerns. Also, the study offers guidelines and recommendations for the improvement of future MEH technology to increase its energy efficiency, topologies, design, operational performance, and capabilities.

This paper provides an objective overview of state-of-the-art IoT developments in today’s supply chain and logistics research. The main aim is to find examples of academic literature that explain how organizations can incorporate real-time data of physically operating objects into their decision making. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain insight into the IoT’s analytical capabilities, resulting into a list of 79 cross-disciplinary publications. Most researchers integrate the newly developed measuring devices with more traditional ICT infrastructures to either visualize the current way of operating, or to better predict the system’s future state. The resulting health/condition monitoring systems seem to benefit production environments in terms of dependability and quality, while logistics operations are becoming more flexible and faster due to the stronger emphasis on prescriptive analytics (e.g., association and clustering). Further research should extend the IoT’s perception layer with more context-aware devices to promote autonomous decision making, invest in wireless communication networks to stimulate distributed data processing, bridge the gap in between predictive and prescriptive analytics by enriching the spectrum of pattern recognition models used, and validate the benefits of the monitoring systems developed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained considerable attention in different academic and real-world research domains. Due to the data-driven nature of IoT, the data aggregation process in such systems is significantly challenging. The main goal of data aggregation mechanisms is to achieve high Quality of Services (QoS), including optimal data transmission delay, reliability, and energy consumption. Despite various types of available review papers on this particular topic, we feel that the existing literature does not satisfy the requirements of being up to date and comprehensive. This paper presents a systematic literature review for data aggregation mechanisms on IoT that illustrates the critical challenges in the context design issues. Further, the data aggregation mechanisms are divided into two main categories: client-server-based and mobile agent-based ones. The client-server-based data aggregation mechanisms are also presented in three groups: cluster-based, tree-based, and centralized methods. Finally, we outline possible future research trends in data aggregation on IoT.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cloud computing, the most crucial computing and storage tool in IoT (Internet of Things), still meets various challenges. The remoteness of IoT end devices from cloud platforms may lead to significant issues for real-time applications such as disaster handling, healthcare application, etc. In order to address these issues, fog computing is a new platform with specialized features that perform essential IoT data management and real-time application management tasks. Data management in IoT via fog computing is critical for decreasing latency in real-time IoT applications and is needed to produce more professional knowledge and smart decisions. Reduction in the size of data sent to the cloud layer is a fundamental topic in data management on the fog computing platform. In this paper, to select and survey studies about data size reduction in fog computing, we applied the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process to comprehend and classify the different topics and related approaches in this field. In addition, the studies presented in the edge computing field, which were close to our goal, were also investigated. The primary purpose of this study is to classify and analyze the fog data reduction (FDR) studies published between 2016 and 2022. The topics and related approaches of selected papers are presented in an approach-based taxonomy. The topics of provided taxonomy include data filtering, data compression, data aggregation, data prediction, data pattern recognition, and general facets and related approaches. Finally, open issues for FDR and relevant main challenges are presented in upcoming research.',\n",

Recommerce and the circular economy are growing worldwide as customers and businesses prioritize sustainability. A lack of coordination between channel participants is a significant hurdle to successfully adopting Circular principles in the recommerce industry. This study explores the coordination issue for a circular supply chain consisting of a Web-based recommerce platform and an IoT-enabled original equipment manufacturer. The proposed study is analyzed using a mixed-method research strategy combining a case study with a game-theoretic model. We analyze the problem under a consignment contract with revenue sharing for different channel structures. We introduce a hybrid contract to coordinate the decentralized channel in a cooperative game model. The results show that the consignment contract cannot coordinate the business in a decentralized structure. The recommerce platform achieves perfect coordination through the hybrid contract and obtains a unique Pareto optimization. We are proposing a IoT-enabled system in which resources are not wasted, thereby providing a way for businesses to use the circular economy concept to achieve sustainability goals.',\n",

The sensor node collection section consists of electrochemical probes (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity), hardware conditioning circuits, and Zigbee sending nodes. The measured parameters are identified and converted into electrical signals through chemical probes, amplified and processed by conditioning circuits, and finally converted into digital signals and encoded into data packets through the sending node, which are uploaded to the aggregation node.

The operation and maintenance of IoT devices require a large-scale use of sensors at the expense of high energy consumption. In this work, we develop a self-powered voltage monitoring sensor (VSM-S) based on the principle of dielectric polarization, which is inspired by the cell electrophoresis phenomenon. This sensor imitates the structure of biological cells and takes advantage of the easier polarization characteristics of liquid medium with high dielectric constant in an external electric field. It collects electric field energy to achieve self-powering function and can monitor the position and status of the electric field source in real-time through output signals. Experiments show that the designed VSM-S has the characteristics of fast response (10-9-10-15s), high sensitivity (0.3nA/V), and wide application range. Furthermore, its integration with monitoring systems enables applications in smart industries, smart homes, and smart grids.

This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience.

Intelligence-based infrastructure, also called reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), have been introduced as a potential technology striving to improve system performance in terms of data rate, latency, reliability, availability, and connectivity. A huge amount of cost-effective passive components are included in RISs to interact with the impinging electromagnetic waves in a smart way. However, there are still some challenges in RIS system, such as finding the optimal configurations for a large number of RIS components. In this paper, we first provide a complete outline of the advancement of RISs along with machine learning (ML) algorithms and overview the working regulations as well as spectrum allocation in intelligent IoT systems. Also, we discuss the integration of different ML techniques in the context of RIS, including deep reinforcement learning (DRL), federated learning (FL), and FL-deep deterministic policy gradient (FL-DDPG) techniques which are utilized to design the radio propagation atmosphere without using pilot signals or channel state information (CSI). Additionally, in dynamic intelligent IoT networks, the application of existing integrated ML solutions to technical issues like user movement and random variations of wireless channels are surveyed. Finally, we present the main challenges and future directions in integrating RISs and other prominent methods to be applied in upcoming IoT networks.',\n",

In this work, we present two stage end-to-end DRL based smart agricultural system.

Palm tree is important for many countries’ economies, particularly in northern Africa and the Middle East. Monitoring in terms of detection and counting palm trees provides useful information for a variety of stakeholders; it helps in yield estimation and examination to ensure better crop quality and prevent pests, diseases, better irrigation and other potential threats. Despite their importance, these information still difficult to obtain. In this study, we systematically review research articles between 2011 and 2021 on artificial intelligence (AI) technology for smart palm tree detection. A systematic review (SR) was performed using the PRISMA approach based on a four-stage selection process. Twenty-two articles were included for the synthesis activity reached from the search strategy alongside the inclusion criteria in order to answer tow two main research questions. The study's findings reveal patterns, relationships, networks, and trends in the application of artificial intelligence in the palm tree detection over the last decade. Overall, despite the good results achieved in most of the studies, the effective and efficient management of large-scale palm plantations still a challenge. In addition, countries which their economy strongly related to intelligent palm services especially in North Africa should give more attention to this kind of studies.

       "  'abstract': 'The organic banana is one of the most popular products worldwide and its popularity is mainly due to its excellent nutritional properties and tasty flavor. Peru is considered one of the major producers and exporters of this product, being the city of Piura the main region with most of the national agro-producers. It is also considered a key factor in the development of the economy of this region as it creates job opportunities because of the productive chain required in the process (harvest, post-harvest, and export). The main problem faced by producers is the existence of pests such as Red spot thrips, Black Sigatoka, and others, which affect the production and the quality of the final product. Therefore, this article aims to propose an alternative solution, using the 4.0 Industry technology as well as the installation of an IoT sensor network in banana plantations in order to develop a model which estimates the classification of the pest incidence level based on Machine learning techniques, making use of the atmospheric variables measured with the IoT sensor network as input data. In the research, we have used The Support Vector Machine techniques, which have successfully achieved models with a high level of accuracy. The implementation of this system aims to help producers improve the management of pest control by scheduling spraying dates more effectively, optimizing not only the quality of the product but also reducing costs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Precision, sustainability and intelligence are the development trend of livestock farming in the future. Precision livestock farming (PLF) is a key step to achieve the sustainable development of smart farms, but it is still in the initial stage and has broad prospects. In order to realize precise livestock production, it is necessary to speed up the popularization of intelligent technologies such as environmental control, disease early warning, precise feeding and remote diagnosis. By analyzing the background and technical features of wearable Internet of Things (W-IoT), this paper puts forward a new scheme of applying W-IoT to PLF. Through the detailed survey of the related research on W-IoT and PLF, we believe that precise perception of information, biocompatibility of wearable devices, and sustainability monitoring of wearable systems are necessary contents. However, most wearable technologies that can generate precise, dynamic and sustainable signals are only applicable to humans, and rarely modified or tested specifically for farm animals. At present, these innovative technologies are gradually promoted to livestock farming, which are expected to become one of the most effective solutions for PLF in smart farms. In addition, this paper also discusses the benefits, challenges and prospects of the W-IoT in farm animals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Water is the most valuable natural resource on earth that plays a critical role in the socio-economic development of humans worldwide. Water is used for various purposes, including, but not limited to, drinking, recreation, irrigation, and hydropower production. The expected population growth at a global scale, coupled with the predicted climate change-induced impacts, warrants the need for proactive and effective management of water resources. Over the recent decades, machine learning tools have been widely applied to various water resources management-related fields and have often shown promising results. Despite the publication of several review articles on machine learning applications in water-related fields, this review paper presents for the first time a comprehensive review of machine learning techniques applied to water resources management, focusing on the most recent achievements. The study examines the potential for advanced machine learning techniques to improve decision support systems in the various sectors within the realm of water resources management, which includes groundwater management, streamflow forecasting, water distribution systems, water quality and wastewater treatment, water demand and consumption, hydropower and marine energy, water drainage systems, and flood management and defence. This study provides an overview of the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to the water industry and how they can be used to ensure water supply sustainability, quality, and flood and drought mitigation. This review covers the most recent related studies to provide the most recent snapshot of machine learning applications in the water industry. Overall, LSTM networks have been proven to exhibit reliable performance, often outperforming ANN models, traditional machine learning models, and established physics-based models. Hybrid ML techniques have exhibited great forecasting accuracy across all water-related fields, often showing superior computational power over traditional ANNs architectures. In addition to purely data-driven models, physical-based hybrid models have also been developed to improve prediction performance. These efforts further demonstrate that Machine learning can be a powerful practical tool for water resources management. It provides insights, predictions, and optimisation capabilities to help enhance sustainable water use and management and improve socio-economic development, healthy ecosystems and human existence.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In 2015 the United Nations (UN) presented the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Since then, numerous investigations have addressed this topic. Although there is much research on the SDGs and the relationship between the SDGs and technological advances, there is little research regarding the implementation of technology for sustainable entrepreneurship, how these techniques are developed across industries, and how they can improve the global sustainability of other companies to support the 2030 sustainable agenda. Therefore, this study aims to develop a research agenda for entrepreneurial action, identifying key aspects related to science, technology, and innovation (STI) and the SDGs, and exploring how both concepts are interconnected. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 25,739 papers with machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Using the methodological approach of corpus linguistics (CL) and Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, we extracted keywords, topics, and frequency. The results revealed that (i) there is a research agenda for STI and the SDGs containing 28 topics grouped in three categories: “SDG,” “production business models,” and “partnership and sustainable management models”; (ii) salient topics are “responsible consumption,” “industrial action,” and “sustainable industries”; and (iii) innovation intersects all the topics.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Cloud-to-Things (C2T) continuum combines the proximity of edge infrastructure to the devices with cloud resources to optimize data processing and response time in the Internet of Things (IoT). Proactive edge caching is a potential solution for meeting latency constraints in C2T environments, enabling efficient data processing and storage while reducing redundant computation and cost. However, while 5G/6G infrastructural aspects and caching strategies are extensively studied, no frameworks facilitate the design and deployment of caching strategies or address IoT’s unique requirements. This paper proposes CACHE-IT, a proactive edge caching framework that decouples the caching strategy algorithm from the underlying architecture, enabling customization based on application-specific requirements. Through extensive simulations, we analyzed the impact of different configurations on system metrics and verified that the CACHE-IT positively impacts the system latency and hit rate. By implementing a scenario-specific caching strategy, we illustrate the CACHE-IT deployment in a real-world Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) system. The evaluation demonstrates that CACHE-IT impacts positively in terms of latency, hit rate, and the number of requests sent to data providers.',\n",

Recent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning have led to far more development. IoT has emerged notably in recent times as it upholds endless numbers of applications from smart devices to smart buildings and smart cities covering it all and not only this but also in a variety of domains, helping in communication among the electronic devices that will use sensors for interacting with the environment. The pattern of IoT is flooring the way for the world where maximum number of devices that are interconnected and they collect information from the environment and then automate certain tasks. While dealing with smart devices, some factors such as data privacy, data security, authentication, strength against attacks, valid authorization, self-maintenance, and easy operation are needed to be considered. Features like these can be easily brought into the picture using blockchain technology which was born with the crypto currency called Bitcoin, created by an anonymous group named Satoshi Nakamoto. This chapter will cover the basics of IoT and blockchain and how to adopt blockchain specifically for IoT so that one can have a well-developed blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) system that can be effectively and efficiently be used, such devices are named as BIoT devices and they come under BIoT applications. One of the continuous encounters faced by us in IoT’s triumph is about how to protect and privatize the transactions on the devices each time. It will be rigid to refer a technology that will benefit and will have impactful effect on human life than the IoT and also there is no better technology than blockchain for authenticated and authorized transactions that forms a distributed ledger. This chapter will evaluate how blockchain helps in strengthening the security in the IoT. After unfolding the basics of blockchain, it explains the most pertinent BIoT applications focuses on the influence of customary cloud centering IoT uses.',\n",

IoT manifests itself in a variety of fields that are divided into categories based on the issues that may be handled, such as health, agriculture, networks, cities, and sports. Parking guidance development entails the creation of an IoT-based system that transmits information about available and occupied parking spaces via a web/mobile application. Each parking space has an IoT gadget, which includes sensors and embedded systems. The user is given a real-time update on the availability of all parking spaces and is given the option to pick the optimal position. This study is centered on fully automated parking area utilizing image analysis, as well as or before parking places with sensing and OTP generating. The car park reduces the need for user interaction, increases wage costs, and allows for space well before. The Autonomous Vehicle Parking System allows users to park their cars without the need for human interaction and operates 24 h a day, seven days a week. The Pre-Booking software allows the user can reserve a parking space via this app, reducing the customer's time spent hunting for a parked spot and energy usage. There is still a notification that shows if a space is reserved or available.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Car manufacturers around the globe are in a race to design and build driverless cars. The concept of driverless is also being applied to any moving vehicle such as wheelchairs, golf cars, tourism carts in recreational parks, etc. To achieve this ambition, vehicles must be able to drive safely on streets stay within required lanes, sense moving objects, sense obstacles, and be able to read traffic signs that are permanent and even temporary signs. It will be a completely integrated system of the Internet of Things (IoT), Global Positioning System (GPS), Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL), and Smart Technologies. A lot of work has been done on traffic sign recognition in the English language, but little has been done for Arabic traffic sign recognition. The concepts used for traffic sign recognition can also be applied to indoor signage, smart cities, supermarket labels, and others. In this paper, we propose two optimized Residual Network (ResNet) models (ResNet V1 and ResNet V2) for automatic traffic sign recognition using the Arabic Traffic Signs (ArTS) dataset. Additionally, the authors developed a new dataset specifically for Arabic Traffic Sign recognition consisting of 2,718 images taken from random places in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The optimized proposed ResNet V1 model achieved the highest training and validation accuracies of 99.18\\\\% and 96.14\\\\%, respectively. It should be noted here that the authors accounted for both overfitting and underfitting in the proposed models. It is also important to note that the results achieved using the proposed models outperform similar methods proposed in the extant literature for the same dataset or similar-size dataset.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The urge for greater agri-food supply chain efficiency (AFSCE) has been gaining in prominence increasingly, spurred on by escalating logistics costs and advances in industry 4.0 technologies (e.g artificial intelligence AI). The latter significant contributions in logistics have led academics to point their attention more to AI utility in operations management. Drawing on dynamic capability view (DCV) and organizational information-processing theories, this study aims to examine the effect of AI based technologies on reducing wastes and minimizing afri-food supply chain costs, hence increasing organization profitability. It also analyzes how outbound logistics and distribution network efficiency (DNE) (warehousing, transportation, packaging, etc.) mediates the relationship between AI and AFSCE. This research investigates the moderating impact of AI adoption impediments (AIAI) on the mediating correlation between AI, DNE and AFSCE as well. Using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach, conceptual model and hypothesis were analyzed and tested with 348 responses collected from executives and managers in the Moroccan agri-food industry. As a novel result, distribution network efficiency and by way of mediation AFSCE and organization performance are found to be directly and positively affected by AI integration. The researchers find also that with more AIAI, the relationship between the aforementioned variables weakens.',\n",

This paper reviews the most recent research advances in this direction during the past four years. Specifically, we review, summarize, and categorize existing research works. We divide the research works into four groups according to the roles that the blockchain plays in IoT systems, i.e., access control platform, data security platform, trusted third party, and automatic payment platform. For each group, we also discuss future research challenges. From the review, we further summarize the usage paradigms and open issues on using blockchain to build dependable IoT systems.

       "  'abstract': 'In today’s world, it is vital to have strong cybersecurity measures in place. To combat the ever-evolving threats, adopting advanced models like cybersecurity mesh is necessary to enhance our protection. Cybersecurity mesh is an architecture scalable, flexible, composable, robust and resilient and allows the interoperability and coordination between intelligent systems to provide security services. Designing a cybersecurity mesh faces three major challenges: scalability, distributed or federated systems, and technology integration. For the design, it is necessary to apply security tools that support scalability because millions and millions of data are stored, processed, and analysed. Federated systems are needed to improve interoperability in a decentralized cybersecurity mesh. However, it can be tough to integrate different security tools and communication protocols. Cryptographic algorithms and AI models like federated learning, swarming intelligence and blockchain technologies are useful for security services. It is essential to study the integration of existing methods to determine the best technology for the job. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of intelligent systems, including federated learning, blockchain technology, and swarming intelligence, with a particular focus on how they have been and can be used to enhance cybersecurity. We examine the latest trends in these technologies, explore their connections, and weigh the pros and cons of each approach. To conduct this review, we utilized the Web of Science and Scopus databases and followed the PRISMA guidelines.',\n",

As IoT-based systems are complex and consist of smart objects, so powerful decentralized algorithms supported by SI are used to resolve such complex problems.

SI algorithms are well established and applied in well-known aptitude-based problems where real-time actions are handled efficiently.

The significant growth in human population inevitably places considerable pressure on food supplies. In traditional farming, farmers require good quality soil, natural minerals and also the production relatively consumes more time. The hydroponics smart greenhouse method has been adopted as a result of technological advancements. Hydroponics is a technique of growing plants that does not require the use of soil, and the plants in hydroponics grows in a shorter duration and have higher yields. In normal hydroponics system, a portion of the greenhouse is used for harvesting and the parameters like temperature, and humidity can have an impact on plant growth, and the plants are not properly nourished. In this proposed system, in hydroponics for germination organic coconut coir medium is used rather than rock wool, because rock wool is not bio-degradable and composed of volcanic materials. In the proposed research of hydroponics, the system is automated on a wide scale covering the entire green house with different crops produced in different climatic conditions. The implementation is done on, stable greenhouse environment and plants are grown covering the entire greenhouse, under constant optimal conditions which is favorable to have maximum yield. The prediction of absolute crop growth rate of leafy vegetables is predicted using KNN algorithm under various conditions. The several forms of hydroponics for commercial crop growth has been compared and it has been concluded that NFT along with coconut coir medium is best suitable for hydroponics and it produces an accuracy of 93\\\\%. Macro average, a performance metric for F1 score produces 33\\\\% and weighted average, which represents the number of instances connected to different class labels, produces an accuracy of 93\\\\%.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Plant pathogenic colony-forming aphids are serious pests of agricultural crops. Most aphid species develop colonies, which are several to many aphids that are functionally organized to extract food from plants. Early and efficient detection of aphid colonies enables the implementation of control measures to reduce crop damage. Aphid colonies exhibit different shapes, sizes, and numbers of individuals, and their distribution makes it hard to detect them correctly. This paper investigates machine learning-based aphid colony detection from imagery. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study that uses artificial intelligence-based computing algorithms to detect aphid colonies from images. As such, no aphid colony image dataset is currently available publicly. To mitigate this, we have relabelled an existing insect and pest dataset and repurposed it as an aphid colony dataset (AphColDat). For labelling, first, we automatically identify the regions of interest for colonies based on the locations and distributions of aphids. A novel bounding box merging technique is proposed to generate regions potential colony boxes. These colony boxes are a collection of single or overlapping aphid boxes that co-locate together in a colony. Once the dataset is constructed, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classification algorithm is applied to the images to create AphColDat. This paper evaluates several object detecting deep learning models on the newly developed dataset. The results demonstrate mean average precisions (mAP) of 56.9\\\\%, 53.4\\\\%, 53.1\\\\%, and 48.7\\\\% respectively by Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and EfficientNet. In terms of average detection speed (computational time), SSD and EfficientNet are faster than Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Next generation networks have special areas related with the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve the performance of cellular networks in terms of throughput. Grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) seems a feasible solution, letting machine type communication (MTC) devices transmits their packets when they ready to transmit. GF-NOMA increases the spectral efficiency by using the superimposing signals with different power levels over the same time and frequency resources. However, the main drawbacks of GF-NOMA are randomness and the management of power level selection of MTC devices. In 6G-IoT networks, the intelligence should be met to random access. It is time to design new access methods to solve the GF-NOMA issues that should be between the randomness and fully coordinated medium access. Deep-Q-Network (DQN) has become a very hot research topic in recent years that let the MTC devices to make a smart decision in an intelligent way to improve the throughput. Selfishness is an undesirable behavior of DQN for GF-NOMA system where the resources have different cost. In this study, we develop a novel learning framework for power domain GF-NOMA. The goal of our learning framework is to maximize the throughput considering fairness in power consumption which provides long-life to the IoT network. The learning algorithm push the MTC devices to exchange the resources between each other over time. The results show that the proposed method outperform the NOMA scheme with random selection in terms of throughput and increase the fairness index when the DQN with selfish behavior is employed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Malware detection approaches can be classified into two classes, including static analysis and dynamic analysis. Conventional approaches of the two classes have their respective advantages and disadvantages. For example, static analysis is faster but cannot detect the malware variants generated through code obfuscation, whereas dynamic analysis can effectively detect variants generated through code obfuscation but is slower and requires intensive resources. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for malware detection. It delivers better performance than conventional approaches by combining static and dynamic analysis advantages. First, it visualises a portable executable (PE) file as a coloured image. Second, it extracts deep features from the colour image using fine-tuned deep learning model. Third, it detects malware based on the deep features using support vector machines (SVM). The proposed method combines deep learning with machine learning and eliminates the need for intensive feature engineering tasks and domain knowledge. The proposed approach is scalable, cost-effective, and efficient. The detection effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through 12 machine learning models and 15 deep learning models. The generalisability of the proposed framework is validated on various benchmark datasets. The proposed approach outperformed with an accuracy of 99.06\\\\% on the Malimg dataset. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to show the statistical significance of the proposed framework. The detailed experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the other state-of-the-art approaches, with an average increase in accuracy of 16.56\\\\%. Finally, to tackle the problems of imbalanced data and the shortage of publicly available datasets for malware detection, various data augmentation techniques are proposed, which lead to improved performance. It is evident from the results that the proposed framework can be useful to the defence industry, which will be helpful in devising more efficient malware detection solutions.',\n",

These techniques are importantly applied in various fields such as healthcare systems, transportation systems, agriculture and smart cities to produce fruitful results for number of issues in today's environment. This research work focuses on one such application in the field of IoT together with cloud computing. More number of sensors that are deployed in human body is used to collect patient related data such as deviation in body temperature and others which leads to variation in blood cells that turned to be cancerous cells. Main intention of this work is design a cancer prediction system using Internet of Things upon extracting the details of blood results to test whether it is normal or abnormal. In addition to this, encryption is done on the blood results of cancer affected patient and store it in cloud for quick reference through Internet for the doctor or healthcare nurse to handle the patient data secretly. This research work concentrates on enhancing the health care computations and processing. It provides a framework to enhance the performance of the existing health care industry across the globe. As the entire medical data has to be saved in cloud, the traditional medical treatment limitations can be overcome. Encryption and decryption is done using AES algorithm in order to provide authentication and security in handling cancer patients. The main focus is to handle healthcare data effectively for the patient when they are away from the home town since the needed cancer treatment details are stored in cloud. The task completion time is greatly reduce from 400 to 160 by using VMs. CloudSim gives an adaptable simulation structure that empowers displaying and reproduced results.\",\n",

Furthermore, the nanoparticles exhibit enhanced optical and thermal properties, making them ideal for use in solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic cells. The study also demonstrates that the biosynthesized nanoparticles have a high degree of stability and biocompatibility, which makes them suitable for use in medical and biomedical applications. Incorporating graphene oxide nanoparticles into films increased the energy conversion efficiency by 15\\\\% compared to films without nanoparticles.

       "  'abstract': 'Input optimization is a distinguishing characteristic of Precision Agriculture approaches, helping reduce the environmental impact and costs and increase vegetable production quality. Thanks to the high automation evolution of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), a new approach derived from their combination with Deep Learning techniques is leading to significant improvements in agricultural management practices. The study aims at artichoke plants detection and georeferencing as a first step for an on-the-fly, real time, UAS spraying system, and use the gathered information to monitor crop development through a multi-temporal approach. A commercial UAS, equipped with an RGB sensor, acquired images of the artichoke field located in Sardinia (Italy) during the 2021–2022 season in different crop growth stages. The FPN (Feature Pyramid Network), trained and compared with the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) network, showed a high detection level with an average F1 score of around 90\\\\%, and satisfactory off-line performances on the Nvidia Jetson Nano board. YOLOv5 achieved the best overall result. The FPN recorded a lower recall, which is desirable to achieve a minimum number of detection errors and limit the leakage of agrochemicals on false-positive targets. The multi-temporal approach influenced detection performances, with an inverse response of precision and recall metrics. The growing index trend showed a distinct value in October, peaking at the beginning of December as expected. The proposed approach contributes to designing future automatic and reliable site-specific UAS agrochemicals application and the classification of management zones.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nowadays, many research studies and industrial investigations have allowed the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in current and future networking applications by deploying a diversity of wireless-enabled devices ranging from smartphones, wearables, to sensors, drones, and connected vehicles. The growing number of IoT devices, the increasing complexity of IoT systems, and the large volume of generated data have made the monitoring and management of these networks extremely difficult. Numerous research papers have applied Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to overcome these difficulties by building IoT systems with effective and dynamic decision-making mechanisms, dealing with incomplete information related to their environments. The paper first reviews pre-existing surveys covering the application of RL and DRL techniques in IoT communication technologies and networking. The paper then analyzes the research papers that apply these techniques in wireless IoT to resolve issues related to routing, scheduling, resource allocation, dynamic spectrum access, energy, mobility, and caching. Finally, a discussion of the proposed approaches and their limits is followed by the identification of open issues to establish grounds for future research directions proposal.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Machine learning-based computation has attracted considerable interest in engineering and mathematical sciences in recent years owing to its higher accuracy and precision in tasks of prediction and classification compared with humans. Research has focused, in particular, on embedding machine learning into sensor processing technology to improve the accuracy of the results. In this study, we develop an all-metal-oxide-based transparent and personal ultraviolet (UV)-monitoring system by using a transparent photodetector and a deep neural network (DNN) to prevent people from being exposed to harmful levels of UV radiation. The transparent photodetector was fabricated with all-metal-oxide materials (NiO/ZnO) and was able to detect UV radiation accurately and stably with an optical transmittance of about 77\\\\% (@550 nm). This makes it convenient for use in the displays of various devices. Moreover, it recorded a power conversion efficiency of about 3.65\\\\% under a 365 nm light source, which is sufficient to be used as a self-powered device for the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of the photodetector is sensitive to angular detection which makes it difficult to consistently measure exposure to UV radiation from natural sunlight. To address this issue, we collected data on the photocurrent according to the angle of detection in an experimental environment and used them to train the DNN model. The all-metal-oxide transparent photodetector based on this trained model can accurately and stably measure users’ levels of UV exposure.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Digital twins provide insights into physical objects by serving as advanced virtual representations. Their sensors capture detailed information about an object’s functionality through their use of various sensors. It is possible to gain a deep understanding of the object’s performance and potential areas for improvement by collecting data, which includes metrics such as energy output, temperature, and weather conditions. Digital twins are becoming important in a variety of research and industrial application sectors as production lines and processes become more digitalized and as improved data analysis techniques such as machine learning and enhanced visualization techniques are used. There is no unified definition of the digital twin concept in scientific literature, which results in imprecise applications and the weakening of its terminology. However, this study demonstrates how digital twin models can be applied to urban drainage systems. As a result, this highlights the relatively novel use of digital twins within the field of urban water system engineering. Our review of the language, practices, and directions in smart stormwater management provides a framework to organize and comprehend the current research landscape while highlighting crucial areas for future research. Our results demonstrate that there is near-unanimous agreement within the literature that smart technology has been, or will be, advantageous for stormwater management. However, while some progress has been made in terms of quantity management, maturity in water quality management has not yet been achieved. This study examines the scientific literature on digital twins in the application of artificial intelligence for smart city stormwater infrastructure systems, specifically focusing on urban drainage systems. A demonstration of the workflow and features of current digital twin applications in urban drainage systems is also presented, providing valuable insights and guidance for future research and development in this field.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background Mushrooms are popular food items containing numerous vitamins, dietary fibers, and a large number of proteins. As a result, mushrooms can increase the body’s immunity and prevent many types of cancer to keep the body healthy. For these reasons, the demand for high yields and safety in the production of high-quality mushrooms is increasing. Scope and approach This review highlights the application of computer vision and machine learning algorithms in the mushroom industry. Through a systematic review of papers published between 1991 and 2021, this article introduces key aspects related to mushrooms (e.g., species identification and quality classification based on artificial intelligence), and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches. Key findings and conclusions Numerous artificial intelligence and machine vision technologies have been implemented in research efforts focusing on edible fungi. However, their applications are generally limited to the identification of poisonous mushrooms according to their forms, the plucking of cultivated mushrooms covered by soil, and the mechanized grading of mushrooms. Clearly, the currently available methods cannot meet the requirements of the digitization and intelligentization in the field of edible mushrooms. Considering these reasons, it is possible to develop further application opportunities, such as digital mushroom phenotype determination, and high-throughput breeding based on big data, and mechanical picking by a harvesting robot as well. Therefore, the integration of computer vision and machine learning with the development of more efficient algorithms will undoubtedly be a hotspot for future studies in the context of the mushroom industry.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The Internet of Things (IoT) environment comprises heterogeneous transmission channels. The statuses of these channels may change rapidly due to dynamic variations in things, data, topologies, etc. Thus, many bottlenecks may suddenly occur and dynamically change. Therefore, the quality of services (QoS) may be affected due to the lack of the bandwidth. Hence, this paper proposes a bandwidth control scheme to face the challenge of bottlenecks in the IoT environment. In this scheme, a bottleneck detection methodology, bandwidth prediction approach, reduction of bandwidth usage mechanism, and bandwidth management model are proposed. This bandwidth management model comprises reassigned and reallocated bandwidth plans. To test the proposed bandwidth control scheme, a large-scale simulation environment was constructed using NS-3. The performance of the proposed scheme was measured using the effect of reassigned and reallocated bandwidth plans in the cases of normal and prioritized data. In addition, packet loss, energy consumption, delay and bandwidth prediction accuracy were measured. Moreover, to make sure that the proposed scheme was positively effectiveness, its simulation results were compared to those of the famous machine learning and deep learning techniques: long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Finally, the simulation results proved that the proposed bandwidth control scheme notably outperformed the IoT environment's efficiency and limited the negative impact of the bottlenecks.\",\n",

This network is expanding day by day in response to the need for affordable, compact, and advanced energy infrastructure pursuing the key goal of improving energy services in societies. The great cumulation of Internet-connected objects paves the way for the emergence of the community of smart objects that is called the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT eases virtually controlling energy processes in almost every domain of society. Hence, this technology is intended as one of the main tools for the realization of grid modernization schemes. As future energy grids are going toward fully renewable energy networks, the capable technologies are the essential requirements of the modern grid in providing sufficient flexibility for keeping its sustainability. When it comes to how to implement such technologies in practice, the immense potential of the IoT technology has made it as a strong contender for the feasibility of programs with advanced technologies. On the other hand, the integrated operation of energy networks due to the emergence of hybrid energy devices adds more complexities to the grid’s developments. Herein, IoT technology brings a widespread network of smart systems with a variety of capabilities, particularly in terms of networking, storage, and computing.

This analysis highlighted the substantial contribution of DATs across five key categories: Recording and Mapping Technologies (RMT), Guidance and Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF) Technologies, Variable Rate Technologies (VRT), Robotic Systems or Smart Machines (RSSM), and Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS). Specifically, it provided an overview of the various benefits that these technologies can deliver with the most significant ones revealing reductions of up to 80 \\\\% in fertiliser usage with RMT and CTF applications, while VRT demonstrated a 60 \\\\% decrease in fertiliser usage and up to 80 \\\\% reduction in pesticide use. VRT also showed an increase in yield by 62 \\\\%. RSSM was able to reduce labour by 97 \\\\% and diesel consumption by 50 \\\\%. FMIS improved yield by 10 \\\\% to 15 \\\\%, facilitating simultaneous reductions in labour and input costs, illustrating the critical role of integrated digital solutions in enhancing agricultural efficiency and sustainability. From an environmental point of view, VRT has emerged as a major factor in environmental sustainability, demonstrating water savings of 20 \\\\% to 50 \\\\% in vineyards and pear orchards and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

       "  'abstract': 'This review examines literature from 2011 to 2020 on information and communications technologies (ICTs) and blockchain technologies (BTs) in agriculture. To describe the status of the subjects and identify issues for future research, we utilized bibliometric and content analyses of leading journals. The main findings are: (1) ICT technique adoption is affected by application design and socio-demographic factors, while research in BTs in this area only focuses on application design factors; (2) ICTs and BTs have similar applications in agricultural production (information provision for efficient decisions and production improvement), logistics (tracing), and supply chain (trust-building); (3) ICT techniques are applied more to production improvement, while BTs focus more on using visibility, traceability, and automation to improve transparency and transaction efficiency in whole sectors; (4) in relation to consumption, ICTs focus on balancing supply and demand to achieve market stability, while BTs investigate effects on consumer purchasing decisions. Insights are also proposed for future research based on common challenges in the application of ICT and blockchain in agriculture in the following areas: (i) security and privacy protection; (ii) solutions for scalability and interoperability; (iii) solutions for high cost and high consumption, and demands for high knowledge in technology application; (iv) formulation of policies and regulations related to standard criteria for market stability. This review provides a basis for studying the combination of ICTs and BTs in agriculture and furthers the understanding of their usage by comparison; this has significant implications for technological development and agricultural sustainability.',\n",

However, there has not been significant work on the comprehensive and sequential applications of blockchain integrated IoT in e-agriculture for data validation, data storage, data security and data privacy. We aim to bridge this gap in the literature and discuss how the integration of blockchain and IoT can improve backward and forward linkages in agricultural value chains, benefit value chain actors, and augment the performance of IoT network. The study considers use cases of agriculture inputs and commodities/products to demonstrate the application of IoT devices in data collection and blockchain technology for data validation, data storage, data security, and data transmission. RAFT consensus algorithm for permission blockchain and FAIR principles are utilized to make e-agriculture information systems decentralized, efficient, fault tolerant, and interoperable.

These nodes rely exclusively on battery power to maneuver in hazardous environments. So, there is a requirement to study and design efficient, robust communication protocols to handle the challenges of the WSNs to make the network operational for a long time. Although traditional technologies solve many issues in WSNs, it may not derive an accurate mathematical model for predicting system behavior. So, some challenging tasks like routing, data fusion, localization, and object tracking are handled by low complexity mathematical models to define system behavior. In this paper, an effort has been made to provide a big outlook to the current “researchers” on machine learning techniques that have been employed to handle various issues in WSNs, and special attention has been given to routing problems.',\n",

The importance of maintaining privacy in data exchange has been considered by these manufacturers have added dedicated cryptographic modules that are compatible with the main cryptographic algorithms. The most significant problem with these modules is that albeit the use of cryptographic algorithms, there are information security weaknesses in hardware implementations to be considered. The purpose of this survey is to theoretically compare the characteristics of the development boards currently used for cryptographic applications in IoT systems. From a rigorous selection, seven of thirty-one possible development boards for IoT were selected and compared under two fundamental requirements: low-cost and cryptographic security mechanism offered.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been experiencing rapid progress in the last few years, and it is becoming an important tool to address the impact and challenges of an aging population. Therefore, this research introduces population aging and artificial intelligence into agricultural production, focusing on the effects of population aging on food security and the function played by artificial intelligence in it. From an empirical study conducted based on provincial panel data, the following conclusions arise. First, population aging in rural China has not negatively impacted food security, so there is no need to be overly pessimistic about the inevitable aging of the rural population. Second, AI has a favorable moderating function on the effects of population aging on food security. Third, the moderating effect of AI is heterogeneous. Compared with other provinces, AI can play a strongly positive moderating effect in central and west regions and major grain-selling areas. Based on the above findings, this paper proposes targeted policy recommendations on protecting food security in the context of artificial intelligence and population aging.',\n",

Surprisingly, different research shows that there is a considerable gap between technology and agricultural practices, even in developed areas, although the technological development in this field is advancing on a daily basis. This paper first gathers general information about agriculture from local farmers in a developing country through questionnaires. We also focus on farmers’ opinions about technology in agriculture and what type of barriers they encounter when it comes to implementing it in their daily work. Then, after identifying barriers, we suggest recommendations about the type of technologies that can be used and adapted in the region where questionnaires were conducted in order to find solutions for identified barriers. The solutions include technical implementations with a focus on low cost and usability (user friendly) with the goal to also extend to regions with similar characteristics.',\n",

Data were collected from 120 respondents from 10 types of businesses in Bangladesh and analyzed using MS Excel and SPSS (V. 25). According to the results, using AI in enterprises may have a significant positive impact on efficiency, decision-making, production, cost, fraud detection, and supply chain optimization. However, obstacles to AI deployment include a lack of qualified personnel, poor data quality, money, infrastructure, and legal frameworks. Businesses should raise employee understanding of AI, look for diversified financing and qualified personnel, work with the government on infrastructure support and legislation, address concerns about job displacement through training, and encourage employee acceptance of change in order to overcome these challenges. Businesses in Bangladesh may improve operations and competitiveness by using these techniques. Business executives, decision-makers, and academics interested in maximizing the potential of AI and enhancing business outcomes in Bangladesh might learn from this study.\",\n",

Several surveys have covered different IoT-centered issues, namely vulnerability simulation, intrusion detection systems, and state-of-the-art techniques were put forward for this purpose. In comparison, we concentrate exclusively on the emerging IoT vulnerabilities and related Artificial Techniques in the current research. This paper initializes the detailed categorization of recent research works, which explore different Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for the IoT paradigm. Additionally, a novel taxonomy is included based on IoT vulnerabilities, corresponding attackers, and effects, threats that explore weak links, effective remedies, and organizational authentication technologies that are currently available to recognize and track such deficiencies. This seeks to offer a multidimensional analysis viewpoint on IoT vulnerabilities to the reader, including the technological specifics and effects, which are intended to be leveraged for remediation goals. Inspired by the lack of IoT paradigm-related scientific (and malicious) evidence, the current study provides an emphasis on IoT manipulation from passive measurements. The current research illustrates the seriousness of the IoT problem while offering organizational knowledge resources that will inevitably assist in the mitigating mission in general. In addition to open issues and research concerns, informative conclusions, inferences, and results are revealed in the current research, which will lead to future research initiatives to resolve scientific concerns relevant to IoT security.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Agriculture plays an imperative role in many countries’ economies and is a substantive source of survival. The variation in a soil nutrient decreases crop yield. An accurate soil fertility classification and application of fertilizers are essential for enhancing crop productivity. Currently, soil fertility levels are assessed through laboratory testing of soil samples, and fertilizers are applied randomly. This traditional practice increases fertilization costs and causes environmental pollution. Thus, it is necessary to develop robust and inexpensive soil fertility classification and fertilizer application. This study identifies the machine learning (ML) or deep learning-based soil fertility classifications. A comprehensive review is conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The purpose of this study is to examine different approaches that researchers use to predict or classify soil fertility. It also discusses the fertilizer recommendation developed by the researchers. The earlier research showed that ML-based approaches could accurately classify soil fertility. Furthermore, this study discusses the importance of soil nutrients and preventive measures to be taken on the imbalance of soil nutrients. This study explores research gaps and challenges in soil fertility classification and fertilizer recommendation systems. Most studies predicted the fertility levels of soil parameters, whereas a few researchers classified soil fertility. Few researchers recommended fertilizers for soil nutrient depletion. Most studies relied on expensive laboratory measurements or regional soil data collected from satellites. Based on the identified research gaps, this study suggests potential future research possibilities in soil fertility classification and the recommendation of fertilizers. It aims to develop a low-cost soil fertility classifier to prescribe fertilizers. The developed model can help farmers to enhance soil fertility with reduced fertilization costs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Africa's agriculture has over time, improved and expanded in scale and efficiency, yet its productivity is far from its optimum, and the majority of the continent is still food insecure. To harness its potential for a drastic increase to avoid continued mass hunger and support the bioeconomy’s growth, farm productivity in Africa must be retooled. This paper examines the role of digitalization as a potential game changer and an impetus for a transformational future for large-scale and smallholder farming and livelihoods through driving technological and methodological innovation and automation. Digitalization is seen here as consisting of four supporting elements: sensors (in situ or remote), wireless transmission of data, artificial intelligence (AI), and transmission of diagnoses and or recommendations to the end user. In addition to strengthening food security on the continent and globally and the ensuing economic benefits, other cross-cutting effects are presented. These include risk management through early warning systems for natural disasters, improved decision-making with big data, reduction in rural-urban migration by the attraction of youth towards agriculture, and the improvement in environmental stewardship and building climate resilience. Challenges to realizing the benefits of digitalization, including lack of infrastructure and human resource expertise and the role of public-private partnerships in developing solutions, are also addressed.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the rapid development of vegetable planting industry, a large amount of vegetable cultivation has helped many farmers get rid of poverty, and China has become the world’s largest vegetable growing country. In the process of planting vegetables, farmers may be threatened by diseases and insect pests. The occurrence of various diseases and insect pests is often irregular. Farmers who grow vegetables mostly use their own experience to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, but experience alone cannot accurately judge the disease and insect pests. Types, which lead to insufficient timely and effective control of diseases and insect pests, affect the growth and development of vegetables and even affect the yield and quality, thereby reducing farmers’ income. With the advancement of science, higher requirements have been put forward to construct greenhouses to provide a more scientific and efficient environment for the growth of vegetables. However, our country has not paid enough attention to the development of agricultural resources, which will not only affect our natural environment but also restrict our rural economic development. Therefore, in order to realize the sustainable development of my country’s agricultural resources and economy, it is necessary to study the coordinated development of rural environmental factors and the economy. This paper designs an intelligent greenhouse system based on remote sensing images and machine learning. Through this system we designed, we can realize remote monitoring of vegetables. Then we can find the threat of pests to vegetable growth for the first time, and reduce the impact of pests on vegetable production and yield. The loss caused by quality, this system has an immeasurable effect on promoting the economic growth of our country’s agriculture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Our prior study focused on development of internet of things (IoT) and edge-compute enabled crop physiology sensing system (CPSS) for apple sunburn monitoring. Edge compute algorithm on CPSS estimated sunburn susceptibility as fruit surface temperature (FST) through pixel-by-pixel multiplication of captured thermal infrared images with segmented fruits binary mask. The segmentation was performed using color-based K means clustering approach. This limited CPSS applicability to monitor sunburn of red colored cultivars only and when fruits develop color, typically late growing season. This is a key research gap as recent weather patterns have shown that sunburn can occur during early growing season when fruits are green to yellow. Therefore, aim of this study was to develop and field evaluate cultivar and color independent mask region-convolution neural network (R-CNN) aided fruit segmentation model and edge compute compatible FST estimation algorithm. Season long field data were collected in 2021 using eight CPSS nodes (three in cv. WA38 [Cosmic crisp] and five in cv. Honeycrisp). Collected data were used to develop and validate mask R-CNN based fruit segmentation model. Developed mask R-CNN based model was able to segment fruits of two apple cultivars and of varying colors with 91.4 \\\\% average precision. In orchard evaluations (2022 season), the resulting algorithm ported on CPSS was able to accurately segment (dice similarity coefficient = 0.89) and estimate apple FST with {\\\\textless} 0.5 °C error compared to ground truth data. With compute time of about 37 s, data processing time was reduced by 22 \\\\% over previous algorithm. High ambient temperature ({\\\\textgreater}35 °C) on a warmer day resulted in multiple throttling errors caused by excessive CPU temperature; however, the CPSS performance was uncompromised in FST estimation. Ambient air temperature did not affect RAM utilization and CPU clock frequency. Overall, developed FST algorithm can potentially be used as input to actuate water-based cooling system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In recent years, the Green Internet of Things (G-IoT) has gained a lot of attention to developing energy-efficient communication systems. It consists of electronic devices and is integrated with numerous tight constraint sensors for observing the real world and provide communication services to end-users. However, optimal data collection and its management among the heterogeneous G-IoT objects are one of the main challenges. Many researchers are still proposing different solutions to cope with such problems and offering IoT-cloud paradigms for processing, storage, and scalability services. However, the data of smart cities is forwarded using the open-source IoT platform, and sensitive information may be compromised. Therefore, this research aims to propose a model of security measures using the Green Internet of Things with Cloud Integrated Data Management (M-SMDM) for Smart Cities. Firstly, it forms a long-run and energy-efficient connectivity using self-balancing trees and distributing load factors uniformly in green communication systems. Secondly, it addresses the problem of secret key distribution between peer nodes and attained trust for both partial and direct communication. In the end, it securing the transmission system from mobile gateways to application users against threats with improved overheads and data latency. The security analysis of the proposed M-SMDM model is done along with simulation-based experiments. The attained results disclose the importance of the proposed model in terms of network parameters compared to existing work.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Context Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising paradigm due to the growing number of devices that may be connected, defined as “things”. Managing these “things” is still considered a challenge. One way to overcome this challenge may be by adopting the software product line (SPL) paradigm and the variability management (VM) activity. SPL engineering consists of mechanisms that provide identification, representation, and traceability, which may be helpful to “things” management supported by VM organizational and technical activities. Objective This research aims to investigate how SPL engineering has been applied along with the IoT paradigm, as well as how VM is being carried out. Method A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted considering papers available until March 2019. This systematic review identified 1039 papers. After eliminating the duplicated titles and the ones not related to the review, 112 papers remained. The number of papers was narrowed to 56 after applying the exclusion criteria. Results The results provide evidence on the diversity of proposed SPLs used to specify approaches for managing IoT systems. However, most SPLs and research developed for IoT lack a systematic and detailed specification to ensure their quality, as well as tailoring guidelines for further use.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Blockchain-based drug supply management (DSM) requires powerful security and privacy procedures for high-level authentication, interoperability, and medical record sharing. Researchers have shown a surprising interest in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities in recent years. By providing a variety of intelligent applications, such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, and smart financing, smart cities (SC) can improve the quality of life for their residents. Blockchain technology (BCT) can allow SC to offer a higher standard of security by keeping track of transactions in an immutable, secure, decentralized, and transparent distributed ledger. The goal of this study is to systematically explore the current state of research surrounding cutting-edge technologies, particularly the deployment of BCT and the IoT in DSM and SC. In this study, the defined keywords “blockchain”, “IoT”, drug supply management”, “healthcare”, and “smart cities” as well as their variations were used to conduct a systematic search of all relevant research articles that were collected from several databases such as Science Direct, JStor, Taylor \\\\& Francis, Sage, Emerald insight, IEEE, INFORMS, MDPI, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The final collection of papers on the use of BCT and IoT in DSM and SC is organized into three categories. The first category contains articles about the development and design of DSM and SC applications that incorporate BCT and IoT, such as new architecture, system designs, frameworks, models, and algorithms. Studies that investigated the use of BCT and IoT in the DSM and SC make up the second category of research. The third category is comprised of review articles regarding the incorporation of BCT and IoT into DSM and SC-based applications. Furthermore, this paper identifies various motives for using BCT and IoT in DSM and SC, as well as open problems and makes recommendations. The current study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a complete review of potential alternatives and finding areas where further research is needed. As a consequence of this, researchers are presented with intriguing potential to further create decentralized DSM and SC apps as a result of a comprehensive discussion of the relevance of BCT and its implementation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Waste disposal in landfills remains a global concern. Despite technological developments, landfill leachate poses a hazard to ecosystems and human health since they act as a secondary reservoir for legacy and emerging pollutants. This study provides a systematic and scientometric review of the nature and toxicity of pollutants generated by landfills and means of assessing their potential risks. Regarding human health, unregulated waste disposal and pathogens in leachate are the leading causes of diseases reported in local populations. Both in vitro and in vivo approaches have been employed in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of landfill leachate, with model organisms ranging from bacteria to birds. These studies demonstrate a wide range of toxic effects that reflect the complex composition of leachate and geographical variations in climate, resource availability, and management practices. Based on bioassay (and other) evidence, categories of persistent chemicals of most concern include brominated flame retardants, per- and polyfluorinated chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and alkyl phenol ethoxylates. However, the emerging and more general literature on microplastic toxicity suggests that these particles might also be problematic in leachate. Various mitigation strategies have been identified, with most focussing on improving landfill design or leachate treatment, developing alternative disposal methods and reducing waste volume through recycling or using more sustainable materials. The success of these efforts will rely on policies and practices and their enforcement, which is seen as a particular challenge in developing nations and at the international (and transboundary) level. Artificial intelligence and machine learning afford a wide range of options for evaluating and reducing the risks associated with leachates and gaseous emissions from landfills, and various approaches tested or having potential are discussed. However, addressing the limitations in data collection, model accuracy, real-time monitoring and our understanding of environmental impacts will be critical for realising this potential.',\n",

One pathway how to achieve this challenge is sustainable intensification, which formulates a coarse goal rather than a detailed guideline. A heterogeneous compound of strategies is necessary and a central aspect involves examining the potential of AI technology to boost production efficiency while mitigating negative environmental consequences. Methodology: To comprehensively examine this topic, two systematic literature searches were conducted. The first aimed to gather information on sustainable agriculture and the environmental costs of conventional practices. The second focused on identifying explicit AI applications and their impact. Results: Numerous examples demonstrated how sustainable AI development drives agriculture towards a more sustainable future. The main contribution of this study is the Data-Model-Purpose matrix (DMP matrix) and the derived Bayesian matrix for a comprehensive analysis of several AI applications in agriculture and their relations to data sources and algorithms.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Online anomaly detection is a key challenge for industrial internet of things (IIoT) applications, as anomalies may occur in data streams from sensors and cause losses or damages. However, most existing methods for online anomaly detection have limitations in efficiency, effectiveness and timeliness, especially with the massive and distributed data streams from IIoT devices. Therefore, developing a data stream processing framework to discover anomalies in time and ensure the proper operation of the system is an urgent issue for IIoT. In this paper, we propose a flexible stream processing framework that enables online anomaly detection for IIoT applications. The framework exploits a distributed computing architecture based on docker containers to improve flexibility, migration capability and customization. The framework also uses a central mediator to coordinate data stream processing tasks running on different docker nodes. Moreover, we develop a prediction-based online anomaly detection model that consists of batch model training and data stream anomaly detection processes. The model uses long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict data stream values and a dynamic sliding window method to model prediction errors and detect anomalies. We implement a case study to detect abnormal heating temperatures from an industrial heating plant and evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and anomaly detection model. The results show that our framework and model can achieve high accuracy and low latency in detecting anomalies, and they outperform existing methods in terms of scalability, efficiency and adaptability for IIoT applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Nanogenerators (NGs) are one of the promising energy solutions, which collect different forms of energy in the environment, and have great potential applications in self-powered systems, the Internet of Things, and blue energy. NGs are commonly applied as power supplies or transducers. To be designed into an outstanding power supply, the output performance should be evaluated by a standardized indicator series. Despite the existing standard, the output performance evaluations in the field are still using a series of indicators such as charge density, current density, output power density, and root mean square power density. Meanwhile, the non-linear time-strain-electric signal relation requires an up-to-date quantitative method. After more than half a century of development, machine learning (ML) has been able to adapt to the research needs of many disciplines. ML was proven applicable for multi-index evaluation, non-linear high-dimensional information processing, and distributed data analysis. In this article, interdisciplinary connection is established. The current works can be divided into eight categories: (1) Equipment optimization and fault diagnosis, (2) Information security protection, (3) Intelligent devices for sports and healthcare, (4) Human-machine interaction, (5) Object recognition, (6) Intelligent transportation system, (7) Intelligent Sound System and (8) Environmental protection. According to the existing literature, principal component analysis (PCA), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and a variety of deep learning (DL) and related algorithms are used, producing better numerical results than traditional algorithms in certain scenarios. Based on the analysis of the current reports, the development trends and challenges of NGs and ML are discussed. In the future, much more comprehensive application of ML and NGs will certainly cause great repercussions in the research field.',\n",

It is currently considered a worthy successor to the barcode system and has significant advantages for monitoring products in the perishable food supply chain (PFSC). The present study proposes a traceability system that utilizes RFID and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. RFID technology can be used to track and trace perishable food while IoT sensors can be used to measure temperature and humidity during storage and transportation. Furthermore, it is important that RFID gates can identify the direction of tags and whether products are being received or shipped through the gate. In this study, machine-learning models are utilized to detect the direction of passive RFID tags. The input features are derived from receive signal strength (RSS) and the timestamp of tags. The proposed system has been tested in the perishable food supply chain and has revealed significant benefits to managers and customers by providing real-time product information and complete temperature and humidity history. In addition, by integrating a machine-learning model into the RFID gate, tagged products that move in or out through a gate can be correctly identified and thus improve the efficiency of the traceability system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today. The large amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activities, especially the emission of carbon dioxide, is an important driving factor behind climate issues. Under the background of China’s “3060” decarbonization goal”, Chongming District in Shanghai is actively promoting the construction of a world-class ecological island and is committed to creating a carbon–neutral demonstration zone with global influence. However, Chongming District faces challenges as the mechanism of carbon-neutrality transition path remains unclear. The data related to evaluating carbon neutrality status are heterogeneous from multiple sources. It is difficult to effectively implement relevant evaluation and response measures, impeding the progress of its low-carbon transformation. In response to the aforementioned challenges, this paper will propose and discuss the potential methods based on the new generation of information technology, represented by big data and artificial intelligence. These technologies aim to facilitate the integration of diverse factors, including carbon, and explore the nexus among them, thus exploring pathways for low-carbon transformation, and ultimately achieving decarbonization goal in Chongming District. Hopefully, the research conducted in this paper will contribute to the efforts of China and the global community in addressing carbon-related challenges and advancing towards a more sustainable and low-carbon future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'As the IoT expands its influence, its effect is becoming macroscopic and pervasive. One of the most discernible effects is in the industries where it is known as Industrial IoT (IIoT). IIoT provides automated, comprehensive, regressive and easy-to-use methods to look over its components. Along with the benefits, it also brings concerns that spawn from the IoT itself. Moreover, the challenges in the industries also add up because they have their own set of requirements and procedures to perform. Among those challenges, one of the prominent is DDoS attacks. So, through this paper, the DDoS attacks in IIoT is studied. This paper has culminated the work done in the domain involving IoT and IIoT. With this different forms of attacks involved in DDoS, the tools involved in generating the attacks and the overall traffic generators is also discussed. To elucidate, IIoT architecture and various layers involved in communication is discussed to correlate the threat of DDoS attacks in IIoT. Further, the studies made in various categories such as machine learning, deep learning, federated learning and transfer learning is elaborated. Finally, the challenges present in IIoT and the security requirements needed to overcome challenges in IIoT is explained.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most rapidly evolving networking concepts, offering various applications for human benefit. Advances in embedded system architecture and compressed IPv6 have enabled IP stack functionality in resource-constrained heterogeneous smart devices. The IETF Routing Over Low power and Lossy network (ROLL) Working Group (WG) devised IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) to enable the communication between network nodes in IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN). The limited resources and heterogeneity of 6LoWPAN nodes make it challenging to design a security solution for Low Power and Lossy Networks, making them vulnerable to various security threats and attacks. Numerous security mechanisms based on trust, threshold, secure routing, authentication, and encryption have shown promising results in detecting anomalous activities in RPL-based 6LoWPAN. As a result, this study systematically examines and critically analyses the existing research domain on RPL security mechanisms. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of demographic characteristics, existing and new attacks, simulation programmes, network configuration, and evaluation measures in RPL-based 6LoWPAN. In addition, it proposes a thorough discussion of current issues, research challenges, and suggestions for future research avenues. This study reveals that most of the studies are published in IEEE Xplore® database and mainly comprises journal articles. Furthermore, the trust-based mechanism is the most used security mechanism for securing RPL-based 6LoWPAN. Finally, the Version Number, BlackHole, and Sybil attacks are the most discussed attacks in the selected studies.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Grain storage in bag silos has increased in recent years, mainly due to the low initial investment cost. However, there is no control of the ecosystem that involves the biotic and abiotic factors of storage. Thus, the objective was to develop and validate a prototype wireless sensor network and Internet of Things (IoT) platform for real-time monitoring of intergranular equilibrium moisture content and predict through neural network algorithms the physical, physical quality-chemical and microbiological mass of corn stored in bag silos. For an evaluation over three months, the experiments were installed with corn grains with two initial moisture contents of 13 \\\\% and 18 \\\\% (w.b.), three storage environments with temperatures of 17, 23, and 30 °C in bag silos. It was observed during the monitoring of stored grains, variations of moisture balance hygroscopic that indirectly inferred the quality of corn. The prototype and device with temperature sensors and intergranular relative humidity of the grains stored in bag silos were adjusted, obtaining satisfactory results for the determination of the equilibrium moisture content curves of the mass of corn grains stored, in real-time, connected to an IoT platform, for indirect monitoring of the quality of stored corn grains over time. In the moisture contents of 13 \\\\% and the storage condition of 17 °C they had the best quality results, while in the storage in bag silos with moisture contents of 13 \\\\% and 18 \\\\% showed no differences in the condition of 23 °C. However, at a temperature of 30 °C, the grains suffered a high deterioration. Furthermore, the quality prediction results using Artificial Neural Networks algorithms, indicated a high coefficient of determination of the trained models, presenting itself as a promising perspective, mainly in develop embedded technologies for monitoring and predicting qualitative variables of corn stored in bag silos.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Cotton requires multiple processing steps to convert the raw agricultural products into finished textiles. Genetic and environmental factors, crop management decisions, and processing practices interact to affect optimal end use, product quality, and process efficiency. Currently, only limited data sharing occurs between sectors of the cotton industry, primarily the official USDA classing data used to determine the value of cotton bales. Increasing digitization could improve productivity, sustainability, and competitiveness with synthetic fibers. Current research has focused on utilizing RFID technology incorporated in a recently introduced harvest system for logistics and associating cotton fiber quality with field locations. Gins and textile mills use some connected sensors; however, their use is primarily limited to remote monitoring and diagnostics. In the future cotton industry, a much larger number of connected devices and sensors can provide information on the production and processing history of raw materials. Developments in agricultural robotics will offer a platform for measuring yield and quality on a site-specific basis in the field. Additional networked sensors and devices at gins and textile mills will provide additional information on product quality and process efficiency. Networking these connected devices will allow for the development of advanced analytics for optimizing logistics and processing industry-wide. Several challenges must be addressed to successfully implement IoT devices in the cotton industry. Improved rural broadband access and more suitable wireless networking protocols for field sensors are needed, although recently introduced technology may offer potential solutions. The cotton industry needs to develop appropriate data standards and data sharing policies. Integrating these data sources creates a new management paradigm, but research will be needed to optimally use this data.',\n",

Several organizations have started fusing AI into their food production process in order to satisfy more customers, earn profits, and meet with competing demands. In the food processing business, the use of AI techniques and intelligent optimization algorithms increases productivity, decreases waste, boosts product quality, and promotes sustainability. Thus, AI techniques are of huge importance for the food industry, where they have enabled us to achieve optimum results in real time. This chapter focused on the use of intelligent systems such as AI for food manufacturing, processing, storage, and food marketing. It emphasizes how effectively AI is used in various facets of the food industry, such as sorting, grading, food quality, cleaning, effective supply chain management, microbial control, and various methods of food analysis. To produce the highest quality food items, AI is applied along with chemical and biological sensors for food quality monitoring. The challenges of AI in the food industry such as data quality, interpretability, integration, and regulation were reviewed. The use of AI to improve food production processes is still being studied, despite these obstacles. However, it is imperative to emphasize that the advantages of AI applications in the food industry far outweigh the drawbacks.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The work aims to develop an automatic recognition model to classify medicinal plants using machine learning techniques to enrich the traditional medical system of India. Though many countries have accepted conventional medicine as the best alternative to synthetic drugs, there exists limitations such as lack of awareness among general public and unavailability of easy access to its source evidences that has led to its limited acceptance and usability. Herein, an intelligent system is proposed to use Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (RPi) and the RPi camera to capture the leaf images of Indian medicinal herbs and reveal their medical properties. Five types of models implemented to identify the medicinal plants. One of the models proposed as Herbmodel extracts a feature map from a captured medicinal leaf by combining three different feature extraction techniques, namely, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) and histogram of oriented gradients on support vector machine as a classifier, predicts an average accuracy of 96.22\\\\% over a custom medicinal leaf dataset of 40 different species containing 2515 samples. Generate Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) by applying K-Means clustering on both SIFT and ORB descriptors to reduce the dimensionality. The combined feature vector is further analysed using random forest and k-nearest neighbor classifier. The efficacy of the proposed approach is benchmarked using Flavia dataset and artificial neural network (ANN) as a classifier. Our findings prove that the combination of local descriptors is an efficient measurement approach that benefits automatic recognition of plants based on leaf images. Also, a reliable source of medicinal leaf datasets with good quality leaf images is necessary to establish a machine learning model for medicinal plants.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Industry 4.0 has the potential to create new industrial revolution by offering intelligent, secure, independent, and self-adaptive Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. These IIoT nodes can be grouped via the clustering process into clusters to enhance networks’ efficiency, lifetime, and scalability. However, it offers several benefits but still security is a primary concern, which can be resolved by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and blockchain technology. Therefore, an effective Blockchain-Assisted Cluster-based Intrusion Detection System for IIoT, called the BAC-IDS technique has been devised. The proposed BAC-IDS model aims to cluster the IIoT devices for detecting the intrusions and enabling blockchain-based secure data transmission. BAC-IDS technique involves Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)-based clustering technique to choose the Cluster Heads (CH) effectively and construct clusters accordingly. In addition, Chicken Swarm Optimization with Gated Recurrent Unit-based intrusion detection is also followed to determine the presence of intrusions in IIoT environment. Moreover, blockchain technology enables secure data transmission from Cluster Members (CMs) to CHs. The design of HHO clustering and CSO-based hyperparameter optimization for the IIoT environment represents the novelty of the proposed work. A wide range of simulations are performed under different aspects. From experimental results, it has been observed that the BAC-IDS approach has gained a TNR (99.97\\\\%), AUC (99.96\\\\%), precision (99.99\\\\%), recall (99.97\\\\%), accuracy (99.98\\\\%), F-score (99.98\\\\%) and error rate (0.03) on NSL-KDD2015 dataset.

The IoT presents us with several design challenges at all architectural levels. This ranges from the overall architecture at the highest level to device connectivity at the lowest level. In this complex design, it is easy to get lost in the forest of the latest IoT offerings without understanding the underlying solution patterns. In this study, we have mapped several IoT architectural patterns, spanning several industry verticals, by analysing the literature that report on real-world IoT implementations to identify common, recurring solution patterns.

The authors of the book: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, are often referred to as the ‘Gang of Four’. and Christopher Alexander’s pattern language, as well as some recent advances in the IoT space, we have identified some systematic methods which are used to organise the IoT patterns.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) induce corporates to re-design their innovation process. Due to rapid technological development, synchronization of information systems, and industrialization, corporate managers increasingly adopt AI in innovation. In response, scholars are interested in the idea of creating and mapping the intersection of AI in corporate innovation, which resulted in massive literature during the past decades. To critically analyze the phenomena of AI in corporate innovation, we conducted a hybrid review of published literature (364 articles) for the last 56 years (1996 to July 2022). We present taxonomy, outline AI phases, AI large scope definition, and link with innovation. We identify eight focal fields in the intersection of AI in corporate innovation, such as AI and business models (BM), AI and product innovation, AI and open innovation, AI and innovation process, AI and firm's innovation structure, AI, firm's knowledge and innovation, and AI, innovation and firm market performance, and AI and innovativeness of supply chain management. We outline a framework encompassing the role of AI in corporate innovation. We conclude this study by identifying influential aspects of literature and presenting future research agendas.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Parallel to the rising debates over sustainable energy and artificial intelligence solutions, the world is currently discussing the ethics of artificial intelligence and its possible negative effects on society and the environment. In these arguments, sustainable AI is proposed, which aims at advancing the pathway toward sustainability, such as sustainable energy. In this paper, we offered a novel contextual topic modeling combining LDA, BERT and Clustering. We then combined these computational analyses with content analysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly topics, sub-themes and cross-topic themes within scientific research on sustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics including sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management, climate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, convergence of AI with IoT, AI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering education and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future research strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. In addition to its theoretical contribution to scientific research on sustainable artificial intelligence in energy management, the research utilizes a novel topic modeling method in exploring scientific texts and identifying challenges and possible solutions. A variety of solutions was incorporated, including huggingface tool or elbow method, to address these challenges.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Internet of Thing (IoT) is one of the most influential technologies in the present time. People, processes, and things are connected with the Internet through IoT. With the increasing demands of user applications, the number of connections is also increasing exponentially. Therefore, security becomes a critical issue in IoTs. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) services are important for IoT applications. IoTs must also ensure proper authentication mechanisms to ensure CIA in the second stage. Various researches in this direction address the authentication issues in IoTs. In this paper, we survey the authentication aspects in IoTs and their allied domains. We analyze the potentialities of the existing state-of-the art-approaches and also identify their limitations. We discuss the basics of authentication and its related attacks for the ease of interpretability of the readers. We show a taxonomical understanding of the approaches and try to connect the evolution of the solution strategies. These connections, to the best of our knowledge, are novel as compared to the existing authentication surveys. Besides, the multidimensional vision of this survey for IoT extensions is an add-on to the benefits. We also provide a discussion on the future direction of research in this domain. In a nutshell, this survey is a one-stop solution for academia and industry to understand the status quo of IoT authentication schemes/protocols.',\n",
